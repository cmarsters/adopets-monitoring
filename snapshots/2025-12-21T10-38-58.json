    "description_html": "<p>Who loves movie night?! Jade does and she's looking for a couch potato buddy. She's also the hostess with the mostest - she loves having people over and is great at making sure everyone feels welcome! Her foster friends say, \"Jade is house trained and low key in the house. She is not destructive &amp; can be left alone, and she enjoys cuddling but is not super pushy. This girl loves to nap and loves to eat! AKA she is super easy to please. She also sleeps through the night like a gem and has to be woken up by her humans for breakfast. Jade lived with a toddler for 2 weeks and was incredibly gentle. Jade loves to sunbathe and chill in the backyard. She gets excited to zoom around when given the opportunity, but then reverts back to her calm, cuddly self in the house. Jade's only \"difficult\" trait, which I assume is the reason she has yet to be adopted, is that she does need to be in an only pet home. However, with a family with a yard and no other pets, she would be the easiest dog ever and best companion!\"</p>",

Candy Land is house trained, not destructive, and great in a kennel for long periods of time. She has a good balance of energy to play in the yard and a healthy love for napping. She will greet you every morning with full body wiggles and a smile! (Yes, an actual smile!)\r\n\r\nCandy Land knows how to sit and how to go get in her spot, whether that's her bed or her spot on the couch. She has been taught food manners; she will sit and wait until you say yes before eating her meal. She is very food motivated, which is great for training and nail trimming, but don't leave food trash out because she'll happily vacuum up every last morsel! She gently accepts treats and doesn't beg while you finish a meal; a true lady.\r\n\r\nShe would be a great family dog as she does well around older kids. She is dog selective, but has lived with other dogs well matched. She loves car rides and will sit well in the front or the back seat. She even enjoys the window down a little bit!\r\n\r\nFun facts about Candy Land are she does well around farm animals, can bounce on a trampoline, and only barks at the scary Amazon delivery man!\r\n\r\nCandy Land was in the shelter for a long period of time, but has really opened up in foster care to show what a sweet and loving girl she is. Please reach out if you're ready to give this sweet girl the forever home she's looking for!",

    "description_html": "Geedorah (GeeGee for short) has the most striking eyes. Combine those eyes with fun merle spots on her head and she's one beautiful pup!\r\n\r\nThis sweet gal starts out a little shy then really starts to shine once she gets to know you, accepting gentle pets and nicely taking treats. GeeGee loves other dogs-she immediately became fast friends with her foster brother, running around the backyard and playing. She likes but is also respectful of her two elderly, smaller foster sisters when they don't want to play. She was a little interested in her foster guinea pig siblings at first, but once they were shown to her up close, she lost interest. So no problem for her if there are small animals in the house.\r\n\r\nMiss GeeGee is a smart cookie. She learned the dog door in two days from watching her siblings. She's also crate trained and is comfortable in her crate overnight or during the day when her people are at work.\r\n\r\nIf you like walks, this girl can be your best buddy! She easily keeps up with her foster mom for 2-3 miles. GeeGee is also happy to chill with her family. She's really starting to enjoy and seek out couch cuddles both with her people and her foster siblings. The middle of a cuddle puddle is now one of her favorite spots! Geedorah can also entertain herself with toys (stuffies and ropes) and chew treats like benebones. Since she's four years old, she's past the crazy puppy energy but still has many years to love her forever family.\r\n\r\nAt a compact 35 pounds, Geedorah is the perfect size for any household. Come meet this amazing girl and fall in love with your new best friend!\r\n\r\nCheck out Geedorah's Instagram: @adopt_GeeGee_dog",

My foster parents gave me that name since I spent my life being so powerless, now it is my time to learn what it's like to have power. I had a very rough first half of life, and am ready to be loved. I finished all of my medical treatment and am a very healthy boy. I am starting to realize the world isn't so scary. I am still a bit nervous, but love being pet and chilling out with a chew stick. I like to stay glued to someone's leg when I am on the leash and am great about going to the bathroom outside. My foster cat and dog brothers are both spooky to me even when they stand still so I ignore them. My foster rabbit brother isn't as scary to me though. I am gaining a love for life and am looking for my forever human or humans to spend the rest of my life with. I will be your sweetest and most loyal family member!</p>",

He's living in a foster home where he's proven to be very housetrained, for a full work day. He enjoys the security of his crate sometimes  and isn't anxious at all to be left alone and simply sleeps the time away. He does enjoy sleeping by his person if allowed. He likes baths and has learned a love of some toys and short zoomie sessions in the yard. He's been a joy for his foster to watch unfold now that he doesn't have to figure out the basics of life for himself. Reach out to learn more. He's had some light experience around dogs including a smaller dog, and has not yet met cats. A meet and greet with a resident dog can be scheduled at the shelter.

    "description_html": "Meet Daisy Mae, a heartwarming, sweet soul who's slowly finding her way through the world with the love and patience of her foster family. Although she is an incredibly kind-hearted dog, she is also deeply fearful-particularly of people, leashes, cats, and certain confined spaces. Her past experiences have made her wary of many things, but despite this, she's never shown aggression. Instead, she prefers to quietly retreat and observe.\r\n\r\nSince forming a bond with her humans, Daisy Mae has become more affectionate, seeking out cuddles and pets, her heartwarming way of expressing her trust. She absolutely loves her many toys, hoarding them with pride, and she enjoys playful games of chase in the backyard, where she feels most at peace basking in the sun. She has no interest in escaping or digging out of the yard-she is perfectly content in her outdoor haven.\r\n\r\nWhile she can be timid around new people, her interactions with other dogs have been positive-she's not reactive and even got along well with a calm Pug who came to visit. Though she doesn't yet feel fully comfortable indoors due to her fear of cats, she finds her solace on the deck, wrapped in blankets, and curled up on a whelping pad. Despite her fears, she's shown remarkable resilience, and though her journey is still unfolding, she's already made great strides toward trust and comfort.\r\n\r\nDaisy Mae is a work in progress-an endearing, shy companion learning to embrace love and connection at her own pace.",

She adores people of all ages (including toddlers!) and gets along wonderfully with other dogs—especially her two large lab foster siblings. While she hasn’t been cat-tested, she’s calm and respectful around everyone she meets.</p><p>\n</p><p>Muffin is medium energy: she enjoys her walks, hikes, and backyard zoomies, then is content to nap and hang out quietly. She walks beautifully on a leash and loves to take in the sights and smells—especially during a neighborhood patrol (she takes her role as squirrel chaser and lawn-watering observer <em>very</em> seriously).</p><p>\n</p><p>She’s happy to accompany you to pet stores, hiking trails, or a lazy day on the couch. At home, she likes being near you but isn’t clingy. She sleeps soundly through the night in her own space, but comes in for snuggles and kisses when the alarm goes off—especially to remind you it's breakfast time.</p><p>\n</p><p>Muffin is house-trained, allows bathing and nail trims, and is very food motivated (favorites: apples, carrots, peanut butter, cheese—you name it!). While she was in rough shape when she arrived—underweight, untrained, and recovering from illness—she’s now healthy, spayed, vaccinated, and thriving.</p><p>\n</p><p>She does have some separation anxiety, especially during long absences, and is on a daily med to help. She’s an angel when her person is home and does fine for short outings with the company of her dog friends. Muffin would do best with someone who’s home often—retired or working from home—who’s looking for a devoted companion to share their day with.</p><p>\n</p><p>Muffin’s breed mix includes Australian Cattle Dog, Great Pyrenees, Pit Bull, German Shepherd, and “Supermutt”—a one-of-a-kind blend for a one-of-a-kind pup.</p><p>\n</p><p>Her foster mom says: <em>“If I could change my work schedule, I would adopt her in a heartbeat. She’s the most loving, loyal little dog I’ve ever met.”</em></p><p>\n</p><p>If you're interested in learning more or meeting Muffin, please click on the \"Get Started\" button now!</p>",

As always, slow and respectful introductions are key.</p><p><br></p><p>If you’re looking for a sweet, silly, cuddle-loving best friend—with heart-melting eyes, zoomie bursts, and a happy dance that can brighten any day—<strong>Chipperoni is your guy.</strong></p>",

She's spent the last few months on an amazing journey back to wellness, and to increased mobility. Bunny can now do everything that dogs do - besides being a great guest at home, she's house trained, she enjoys a little yard time and sunshine on her face. Short walks for exercise help her muscle strength. She's also a fish while guided in a swimming pool. She gives and receives so many affections. She's earned a reputation as a lap dog.</p><p><br></p><p>Bunny has a condition that makes her wobbly and unsteady on her feet, but she is aided by standard traction helpers like rugs, mats and being on flat surfaces when outdoors. Her Help Em Up harness also makes things a whole lot easier to guide her when needed. Bunny will do best in a single story arrangement as an only animal in her home.</p><p><br></p><p>Bunny's care includes occasional skin and eye management, and keeping her muscles in good tone. Her advocates at ClassicCaninesATX have been providing her care at an outside clinic and will help with supplies and some future veterinary care funding for an adopter.</p><p><br></p><p>Are you ready to make a difference in the life of a lady that has come this far already to prepare to meet you?

No repeats, just good boy energy from then on.</p><p>He explored the home calmly, played with <em>every</em> squeaky toy, and then curled up on the couch for a cozy nap. When a familiar friend came to visit, Chicharrón greeted her with happy wiggles and calm excitement—clearly a dog who knows how to balance joy and manners.</p><p>He also did great in the car, hopping right in, entertaining himself with toys in the backseat, and taking in the world through the window with quiet curiosity.</p><p>Chicharrón is the total package: house-savvy, leash-lovin’, toy-obsessed, and full of affection.

She has a neurological condition that affects her balance and coordination (she wobbles when she walks). We believe that Roo was born with this condition, and it will probably not worsen or improve with time. She requires a large litterbox so that she doesn't miss (her foster dad customized one, and it goes with her when she's adopted). \r\n\r\nRoo is an extremely happy, affectionate cat. She is playful (her fave is a wand toy), and she loves nothing more than to be in a lap and snuggle. She walks around well on tile floors, but she does best on carpeting. She can't jump or climb, so a low window that she can look out would be ideal.\r\n\r\nI am a DHC, and I have my own webpage: http://www.desperatehousecats.info/flyers/Roo7099.pdf\r\n\r\nThe adoption fee is waived for Roo and all Desperate Housecats!\r\n",

She sleeps well overnight in her crate as long as she can see you. She’s would thrive with another confident and playful dog.

Every day since he's greeted everyone with a hearty, waggy tail that's earned him \"happy tail\". Once he was neutered another old injury was found at his ventral neck, what appeared to be an old facture, he also has some hip dysplasia and spondylosis. In short, the challenges his body has endured earns him a spot of cozy retreat, don't you agree? He's finally having his first experience in a short term foster home so we can collect notes on his abilities. He's doing great! He's very housetrained, cozy, a cuddler, loves his bully stick chews and appreciates his naps on top of comfort. He loves a good romp and roll in the grass and toys he can shred and all those things he may never have had before. He also can have a doggie friend.</p><p><br></p><p>Are you ready to make a difference in the life of a dog that has earned his right to a normal dog's life for a change?

Who of course gives me snacks. To wrap up the date, we'd go back inside and Netflix and Nuzzle. I'll even let you pick the show as long as I can snuggle up, get some scratches and take a cozy snooze.</p><p>Think this could be it, the true love you've been looking for?

    "description_html": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">Sweet, silly, and affectionate, Ellie is the most beautiful golden girl looking for a soft place to land and a family to call her own. On the labrador retriever color spectrum, one might say she lands somewhere between \"lightly toasted\" and \"golden.\" She has the most adorable ears (one that sticks up and the other that flops over) and the cutest docked tail. She is currently housed with an older, mellow dog and a younger, active dog. She is a fantastic dog friend because she knows how to match the energy and respect the boundaries of anyone she plays with. Ellie is house-trained, a loose-leash walker, quiet (not a big barker from what her foster parents can&nbsp;tell), doesn't get on furniture unless invited, is non-destructive when left alone in the home, and sleeps well throughout the night. When out and about she has met babies, toddlers, teens, and seniors, and has done well with everyone. Her favorite things include walks, napping, car rides, playing, and belly rubs! If you decide to stop petting her, be prepared for her to politely ask for \"more pets, please!\" Ellie is not a fan of rabbits, cats, closed doors in confining spaces, loud sudden&nbsp;noises, or flags flapping in the breeze.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">Because not a whole lot is known about her past, Ellie can still be shy in new situations and around people she doesn't know. In these situations, usually a high-value treat and a little patience goes a long way to winning her over. Ellie would thrive in a home where she can demand all the belly rubs her heart desires, and a cozy place to curl up. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">Click \"Get Started\" to connect with this beautiful pup in person!</span></p>",

Sosa can hear and follow me via by calling his name, clapped hands, and whistles. Sosa can independently walk inside and outside of my house but will occasionally bump a few times around furniture. However, my 8 year old dog guides and plays with Sosa throughout the day. Sosa loves to play with squeaky toys and balls, rolling over the grass, cuddles, belly rubs, and walking in a neighborhood park on a leash. If you're interested in meeting Sosa, please reach out!</p>",

    "description_html": "<p>🐾 Meet Mr. Franco - Your Gentle Giant in Training! 🐾 Looking for an adolescent pup who's already house, potty, and crate trained? Good with dog-savvy kids? Happy to chill by your side while you work or watch TV? Full of personality and gets along with other dogs? Then Mr. Franco might just be your unicorn! At around 7 months old and already tipping the scales at over 50 pounds, Franco is a big-hearted goofball who doesn't quite realize his own size. He's the perfect mix of cuddly and calm, with bursts of excited energy when it's time to play, especially with people, pups, or when there's food involved. Franco is currently in foster care, where he's working hard on his recall, patience, and manners. Like many tall boys, he's been known to counter-surf, but his foster mom assures us: \"We're working on it!\" Hand him a toy or a bone, and Franco's in heaven. 🏡 Ideal Home: Franco will thrive in a home that can offer him a balance of activity and downtime-think daily walks or dog park play, followed by some solid couch cuddles. Due to his size and puppy energy, we recommend a home without cats and without very young children, unless they're experienced with dogs.</p>",

But he also knows how to kick back and relax-whether he's lounging on the floor or curled up in his cozy bed. Hank's pretty smart too-he can sit, lie down, roll over, and shake. He's still learning how to walk nicely on a leash, but he's eager to improve. Overall, Hank's a sweet goofball who just needs a wonderful home to share his love!",

    "description_html": "<p>Meet Buddy, a very respectful young (1.5 year old) boy now living with a 17lb doddle mix and a 40lb lab mix. Though he likes being around his dog companions he really enjoys being around kids playing outside. Game of fetch or just about any other game is ok with Buddy. Inside, he is calm and surrounds himself with as many squeak toys as possible. Though a young boy, he spends most of the day chilled with afternoons reserved for a long siesta. No problems with deer just outside the fence but the occasional squirrel will grab his attention. Though Buddy spends most of the day inside given the high outdoor temps, in the evening and early morning he enjoys being outside watching the world pass. The highlight of the day is his walk. His lease etiquette is being worked on but drastically improved over a short period of time (about 70% there). Buddy understands and obeys basic commands (stay, sit, laydown, off). If he does become excited inside, a simple command to laydown works every time. He is very respectful of the two other dogs living in the house even the little one who often try's to dominate. Too, it's amazing how little he sheds, especially compared to the other two we have but this could change throughout the year. Overall a very obedient calm boy who would love to have someone to play or spend time outside.</p>",

I landed back in the shelter's ICU and they've been keeping an eye on my back right leg. <strong>They said I'm not available for adoption yet but hopefully I'll get cleared after my next round of x-rays!</strong></p><p>At the shelter I was really scared and shutdown but as soon as I got into my foster mom's house and met my foster dog sibling, my whole world changed! They keep saying something about how I'm coming out of my shell but I didn't realize dogs even had those.</p><p>My foster mom says I'm perfectly house-trained and that I'm a Stage 3 clinger. Not quite a Stage 5 because I don't follow you around <em>all the time </em>but I do like to be near my human. When my foster mom is working, I like to be in my dog bed next to her desk and I entertain myself with a chew or stuffie. I'm really into physical touch and sometimes I'll nuzzle my head into your elbow crevice or want to keep my paws on you when I'm resting, my foster mom says I'm completely adorable!</p><p><br></p><p>Here's my wishlist when it comes to a forever home:</p><ul><li>Playful, confident doggy sibling (I love having another dog around, it helps me with my confidence and I love to play!)</li><li>A human who understands I'm shy and a little unsure at first, but I'm very curious and just need time</li><li>Squeaky stuffy toys, and a lot of them! (My favorite pastime is throwing around my stuffies and making them squeak squeak squeak)</li><li>Because I'm not dog reactive and walk <em>okay</em> on the leash (I'm working on it..)

When he first arrived at the shelter, he was completely shut down — scared, unsure, and desperate for comfort. He didn’t want anyone to leave his side, clinging to human connection as his anchor in a confusing world.</p><p>But oh, how far he’s come.</p><p>Thanks to patience, love, and his own incredible spirit, Mr. Shrimp's confidence has bloomed. He’s now a playful, affectionate, and curious companion who checks in often to make sure he’s being the <em>very best boy</em>. Whether it’s cuddling close, romping around with toys, or soaking up praise for his leash manners, he’s all about making you smile.</p><p>Mr. Shrimp is also impressively house trained and eager to learn the ropes of life outside the shelter. He’s the kind of dog who makes you feel special, just by choosing to trust you.</p><p>This brave little guy is ready for his next adventure — could it be with you?</p><p><span style=\"background-color: rgb(247, 247, 252); color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">If you have any questions, please reach out to&nbsp;</span><a href=\"mailto:orangedotcrew@gmail.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">orangedotcrew@gmail.com</a><span style=\"background-color: rgb(247, 247, 252); color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">&nbsp;to kickstart this heartwarming journey.

    "description_html": "<p>Per Disco's previous foster: Disco is a sweet, smart &amp; lovable 1.5 year old pup who can be energetic and playful yet mellow when just hanging out. He is crate &amp; potty trained, and does very well just sitting on the porch or while we watch tv! He's very well behaved, knows \"sit\", \"down\", \"stay\", &amp; \"place\" (his crate &amp; bed). He loves tug of war, hide &amp; seek, and long morning &amp; evening walks. Still a young pup, he needs long walks &amp; play time to tire out his mind &amp; body - we've been walking around 3-4 miles a day! Although he does get very excited on walks &amp; pulls a bit to sniff all the smells, &amp; play with all the dogs (usually he can walk past with some peaked interest, but sometimes he does get real excited and itches to play with a very light whine and jump - were working on his focus &amp; distractions with treats + positive reinforcement when he looks up at us or checks in) with some consistent training &amp; socialization I'm certain he'd keep his attention at bay in no time! Despite his happy go lucky spirit, Disco also knows how to chill at home. He's easy to get in his crate, will sleep next to you for hours during a mellow day, and overall just loves laying down close to people. He's just about 50lbs and shouldn't grow much more, so he's perfect to take in the car (his car manners are perfect) and on adventures! Disco would be a wonderful fit for an active home willing to dedicate some time towards cuddles, tug-of-war, + a little bit of discipline &amp; consistency!</p>",

He's great on a leash and loves car rides (hello, hiking buddy!), but he's also perfectly content to relax at home. His calm, chill demeanor makes him an easy and wonderful companion.</p><p>Bear is highly food motivated, eager to please, and learns commands lightning-fast. Best of all, once he's comfortable, he’s a massive lovebug who insists on being your little small spoon for every snuggle session! Bear is crate trained and doing fantastic with his house training.</p><p>\n</p><p>Instagram: @adopt_bestboybear.</p><p>\n</p><p>What Bear Needs:</p><p>Bear is a star when he's out on walks—totally non-reactive and composed around people! However, because he hasn't always been treated kindly, he needs slow, thoughtful introductions to new faces trying to pet him as he's still learning that not all new humans want to hurt him. We are actively working with a professional trainer, using positive reinforcement, to help him trade fearful memories for happy ones. Bear happily takes treats from people and can chill while you have a conversation.</p><p>\n</p><p>Dog Friends: He's dog-friendly and would love to live with a confident dog(s) who can help boost his own bravery. He currently resides with 2 small dogs and 2 cats!</p><p>\n</p><p>An Adult-Only, Cat-Free Home: Bear is not ready for kids rushing him and would most likely prefer a home without cats. However, he currently lives with cats in a small home and we feel in the right environment they could eventually coexist.</p><p>\n</p><p>He is currently undergoing heartworm treatment, but his foster can provide all the details on his path to a full recovery! This treatment can be transferred to the adopter at no charge.</p><p>\n</p><p>Follow Bear’s journey and get to know him better on Instagram: @adopt_bestboybear. You can also check out his brother Teddy who is up for adoption too!</p>",

She's great with other dogs (a meet-and-greet is advised) and is a very easy passenger in the car. This pup loves to play, especially chasing balls, and is <em>always</em> ready for food and treats. She's working on enjoying walks; she much prefers the comfy life of a home, but is slowly making progress! Sadie would love a secure yard for her happy zoomies.</p><p>Ready to welcome this professional snuggler into your life?</p>",

    "description_html": "<p>Nova was surrendered due to their owner's living arrangement changing. She's Smart, loyal, sweet, and playful. She's a very good girl for baths, too! Nova's favorite things are taking walks with her people, chasing balls, playing with squeaky toys, and enjoying a chew toy. Nova has lived with small and large dogs previously. She's awaiting her new home today!</p><p><br></p><p><u>From her foster parents: </u></p><p><br></p><p>Nova is an extremely sweet and curious dog who loves to be involved in every single conversation and is always eager to receive cuddles and praise. She loves eating kibbles and will drink lots of water when she's thirsty after long walks! She can be a little picky about her treats – for instance, she does not love peanut butter treats so you may need to experiment. Nova is shockingly tolerating of baths, but she does not love getting her paws and eyes cleaned.</p><p><br></p><p>Nova loves running after balls but does not yet know how to retrieve them (maybe you can teach her!). She loves cars and car rides, and she is learning not to jump and lick when she is excited (to see you!). She may proudly carry your socks to you as a gift, and we still don't know why! She loves to sleep with you but can be trained not to if you don't want her on the bed. She is a little apprehensive of kids and may bark if they get too close. Nova is also protective of you and will bark at strangers in your home, but she becomes friendly when you tell her it's okay. She cares a lot about her people and will run over to help if you seem unwell.</p><p><br></p><p>Nova loves going on walks but is also very happy to stay home (where she naps and plays). She will run over and sit whenever she hears you pick up the leash! She is also really good at 'sit', especially if you have treats. She is super smart, so with lots of praises and treats, she can learn many more commands! She is very curious and will sniff most things unless it's a mop – in which case she will hide behind you because she is scared of mops!</p><p><br></p><p>She loves following you around the house, but is not anxious to be by herself at home and responds very calmly to being in the crate. When we are outside, Nova makes sure that everyone is included, rushing home whenever someone is left behind! If she does not see you, she may also check every single car in the garage to make sure that you are not in there :)</p>",

    "description_html": "<h3>Meet Clara Bow (aka Bowie)</h3><p>Hi, I’m <strong>Clara Bow</strong>, but my friends call me <strong>Bowie</strong> - because I’m full of star power and a little bit of sparkle! I’m a young, happy girl (about 70 lbs) who loves people, other dogs, and pretty much everything about life. I bring sunshine wherever I go.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>My Favorite Things</h3><p>I’m <strong>house-trained</strong>, love <strong>walks</strong>, <strong>car rides</strong>, and <strong>playing with my dog friends</strong>. I get along great with both dogs and cats (yep, I’m that well-rounded). During the day, I like to explore, play with toys, or hang out with my foster brother. At night, I’ll curl up next to you - I’m a world-class snuggler.</p><p><br></p><h3>My Personality</h3><p>I’ve got that <strong>fun, goofy, young dog energy</strong>, so I’m looking for a family who is able to spend time with me to play. Whether it's with walks, yard time, adventures (bars, coffee shops pet stores, and playing tug-of-war, or another dog, I love living life and exploring. I’m working on my commands and doing great, but I’m young, curious, and sometimes a little “mouthy” when I get excited (never aggressive - just young dog enthusiasm). A patient person that has experience with dogs would be great. I also think I'd be ok with a family that has older kids! I have experience with my foster mom's nieces and nephews who are really young, so that could work too but older kids will be better able to help train me :)</p><p><br></p><h3>My Quirks (aka My Charms)</h3><p>Like any dog who’s had to look out for herself, I <em>really</em> love food. Mealtime is the best part of my day, and sometimes I like to “help” by checking if you’ve dropped anything tasty when you're eating. I’ve also been known to “borrow” things around the house - socks, shoes, pens, you name it - just for fun and to see if they're edible. Everyone needs a hobby, right?</p><p><br></p><h3>What I’m Looking For</h3><p>I’d love a forever home with someone who:</p><ul><li>Has experience with dogs is a must!</li><li>Can spend time playing with me</li><li>Ideally has another dog friend for me to romp around with</li><li>Preferably has a house with a yard or works from home if they're in an apartment. Someone who can dedicate the first couple of weeks to making sure I know you're coming back.*</li></ul><p><br></p><p>*I was adopted once before for just a day, but was returned. I got really scared when I found myself alone in a brand new apartment and without my dog friend. I barked a lot because I didn’t understand what was happening. My adopter worked in an office four days a week and lived in an apartment, so they were worried about that. I don't do this with my current family who has a house and a cat/dog, but if adopted I just need someone patient who understands that adjusting takes me a little time, but once I feel at home I become confident.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">If you’re looking for a loyal, funny, affectionate companion who’ll make every day brighter, </span><strong style=\"background-color: transparent;\">I might just be your Bowie!</strong></p>",

Friendly, calm, and incredibly affectionate, he greets people with a loose, wiggly body, soft eyes, and a happy tail. Within minutes, he’s handing out kisses, leaning in for pets, and soaking up attention like he’s known you forever.</p><p><br></p><p>This sweet boy loves toys — especially soft toys and tennis balls — and will proudly bring them over to show off. In playtime rooms, he’s playful and happy, but he also knows how to relax and enjoy cuddles, belly rubs, and butt scratches. Volunteers consistently describe him as incredibly easy, well-mannered, and one of the most house-trained dogs they’ve met in the shelter.</p><p><br></p><p>Tigger walks beautifully on leash and is very responsive to direction and cues. He knows how to sit, is treat-motivated, and does well transitioning in and out of his kennel. While he may show mild excitement when he sees other dogs, it’s friendly curiosity — he’s non-reactive passing kennels and even stops to give sweet greetings through the gate, complete with wiggly tails and nose kisses.</p><p><br></p><p>He enjoys sniffing around, spending time with people, and would thrive in a home that offers love, routine, and maybe a few good toys to toss around. A house with a yard would be wonderful, but Tigger could also do well in an apartment with regular walks and enrichment.</p><p><br></p><p>Tigger is a laid-back cuddler with a playful side — a truly special dog who’s ready to be someone’s best friend.</p><p><br></p><p>💫 Good on leash</p><p>💫 House-trained</p><p>💫 Affectionate &amp; cuddly</p><p>💫 Toy-loving</p><p>💫 Easy, gentle companion</p><p><br></p><p>If you’re looking for a sweet, loving dog who will adore you back tenfold, Tigger might just be your guy. 🐾💙</p>",

Outside the play yard, Ink is also a great jogging buddy in the making and happily kept pace on a short jog with one of his volunteer friends. He knows sit, likes treats, and is a smart boy who will be easy to train and be up for any adventure with his new people!</p>",

She’s house-trained and crate-trained, has never had an accident indoors, and sleeps soundly through the night. She may whine a bit when you leave or head upstairs (she’s just making sure you remember how much she loves you), but she’s improving as she gains confidence and trust.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">She’s shown interest in other dogs and has been friendly with neighborhood pups, though she can get a bit too excited during greetings.

    "description_html": "<h3><strong>Meet Lady Pablo</strong></h3><p>\n</p><p>She's been recently paired with a couple of sweet makeover agents, her foster parents, who along with the sponsored care she receives from her friends at ClassicCaninesATX, are restoring her body and spirit. She had been left behind in the washroom of an apartment building, heavily matted into a large fur ball. We don't believe she was ever left outdoors. Someone taught this sweet baby love, they simply did not have the ability to care for her.</p><p>\n</p><p>She's spayed and heartworm negative. Her weight is perfect. Her matts have been shaved off and for the first time in years she is walking on her real paws, she can feel wind on her skin, her body is capable of full stretches, she can run and fully \"feel\" again. With that comes time to adjust to her new body and touch, requiring understanding, patience and light management by her VIPs. She loves love and has a spirit that will warm your soul, but can be subject to occasional startles--her body is new to her..</p><p>\n</p><p>Lady Pablo seems to be very content near cats.</p><p>She's had limited engagement with dogs and seems to mostly co-exist, although we think she would prefer to have all of the people attention for herself.</p><p>\n</p><p>Her ideal person or people will have some experience with small dogs that need a little extra help and guidance in life, It's her turn to catch up for all the years she's lost out on.</p><p>\n</p><p>Interested in learning more?</p><p>Click on her link to reach her foster parents.</p>",

    "description_html": "<p>Gorgeous girl Goldie was brought to the shelter as a stray with a fractured pelvis. Shelter staff think she was hit by a car. She spent much of her early puppyhood healing and recovering on crate rest. But she is now healed up, good as new and thriving in foster! Goldie is a lovely Belgian Shepherd mix and a sweet little goofball and will grow up to be an elegant, long-legged blonde!&nbsp;If she was a person, she'd be a supermodel! At 7 months old she is about 40 pounds and will likely top out around 60 pounds She can be a little shy meeting new humans, but warms up quickly. She recently attended several busy adoption events full of new people, dogs, sights and sounds and Goldie was a perfect little lady and behaved beautifully. She was great with all the kids who stopped to pet her as well. She is about 99% potty trained and she's a natural at walking on a loose leash! She loves to play with other dogs and wears out her two big canine foster brothers running around the yard. She has been around a cat and wanted to play with it. But she's still a puppy and can adapt to living with cats. This sweet little lady would make a stellar family dog and a great active buddy for anyone looking for a pup that is equal parts energetic adventurer and snugglebug!&nbsp;Could she be your dreamgirl???</p>",

He enjoys treats, learns quickly, and loves relaxing on the couch or exploring outside.</p><p><br></p><p>Before coming to the shelter, Quin lived peacefully with his finders’ resident dogs and has shown no dog reactivity while at the shelter. He never fails to greet volunteers with wagging softness and calm manners. Once he feels safe, his personality opens up — he’s playful, affectionate, and loves showing off his tricks.</p><p><br></p><p>Quin is treat-motivated and appears to be house-trained. While he starts his walks with enthusiastic pulling, he settles into an easy pace after a while. He can be a little shy at first, especially in noisy areas, and may be sensitive to strangers reaching into his space, so he’ll do best with someone who can let him warm up gently at his own pace.</p><p><br></p><p>Quin would thrive with:</p><p>✔ A calm, patient home</p><p>✔ Adults or older teens who respect his space</p><p>✔ A resident dog who enjoys soft, friendly company (meet-and-greets available!)</p><p>✔ Positive reinforcement and predictable routines</p><p><br></p><p>If you already have a dog, our behavior team can help set up a meet &amp; greet to make sure it’s a great fit.</p><p><br></p><p>Quin is a truly good dog who has handled life's highs and lows with remarkable grace.

    "description_html": "<p>Ash is a very sweet boy, with an instant, huge purr and he loves attention. He’s easy going, loves attention first, last and most everywhere in between if he’s not playing with his sibs. He’s low+ energy so far, maybe a little more as he grows. Use the email below to reach out to his foster directly for more information or to set up a meet/greet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- Email: <a href=\"mailto:adaywithfosters@gmail.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">adaywithfosters@gmail.com</a></p><p>- Pictures &amp; Info: <a href=\"https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fadaywithfosters&amp;data=05%7C01%7CAnimal.Foster%40austintexas.gov%7Cfebe21cf3fee466ca2d008daa1738d5f%7C5c5e19f6a6ab4b45b1d0be4608a9a67f%7C0%7C0%7C637999814936462696%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=Ofs4QLBsSZC3rOwxtBxEn842Rte6kJ2Vw97XR8TzSMw%3D&amp;reserved=0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.instagram.com/adaywithfosters</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ash is middle sized of his five siblings. He enjoys pets, head scratches, belly rubs and he’ll serpentine between your legs for attention. Like all his siblings, he’ll often purr before you even pick him up and he stays in your arms a little longer each time as he and his sibs are learning about being carried about. He’ll politely ask to be put down when he’s ready… and may follow you around… unless he has to run off and play with his sibs. He’s often keenly aware of where you are and watches, ready for attention and sometimes hard to get a picture as he gets up to greet you. He’s often close by to help you find toys under the couch, look in cabinets and even close to help watch you clean litter boxes.</p><p><br></p><p>During the day, he zooms and plays interchangeably with his sibs. He also loves to play with toys of any kind- string, and fast toys like ping-pong balls, rattle mice and springs! He’s social and doesn’t shy away from new people but he’s still maturing and learning to enjoy attention and to relax in a lap. He gently hand wrestles when you play with him, rub his belly, as he nibbles on your fingers or he often licks your fingers. So far, he hasn’t asked for a lap but will chirp at your feet to be picked up. He often crashes near-by, under my chair or under my desk on a blanket near my feet… or he naps/sleeps interchangeably with his sibs. During the day, he sleeps on the sofa with them or high up on the cat tree.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He’s a little soft spoken when you talk to him or he wants your attention when you get close… and he might talk more as he grows. He does speak up when it’s meal time, telling you he’s ready. He climbs a tall sisal cat tree well to nap with his sibs as well and scratches a rope tree very well. At night, he’s often first up on the bed, wanting attention while I read. He likes to be close but so far doesn’t cuddle up… and by dawn, they’re all off playing. I think he would do fine as a solo kitten for someone who works from home, as he loves attention. He would do very well with any of his siblings- Cormac 17077, Pumpkin 17078, November 17079, Wish 17080 or Maple 17081. Ash is polite and not pushy, and think he would also do very well with a cat or a kitten who wants a playmate, even a dog who would like a companion.</p><p><br></p><p>He’s pretty good with the litter box. He’s also very good at getting his front nails clipped when he’s a little snoozy as he enjoys the closeness. He warms up pretty quickly with new people too and doesn’t shy away. I think he’ll do fine with children once used to their energy. He’s fine w/ my older cat and he’s polite to her sniffing, etc. I think he would do OK with a dog too once he gets used to them after slow introductions.</p>",

He wants to bond strongly to a person ( we named him shadow as early on he wanted to be with his foster mom all the time). He cries if we kept him separated from the animals and people in the home. He gets along with all our cats , male and female, but will likely do better in a home with another male cat who will wrestle and play with him or another kitten his age who has a lot of energy. If there are no other pets then he would prefer to have someone who is working from home and wants a kitten to cuddle with them while they work.</p><p><br></p>",

    "description_html": "<p>Sully was found as a stray near the HEB by William cannon and I-35. Not much is known about his life before this moment, but he has made quite the impression in the short time we have had him. From the moment we set eye on him he was a happy gentleman, sitting calmly outside HEB. He accepted food gently, and belly rubs with great enthusiasm. Since that moment Sully has proven to be a mild mannered, medium to low energy dog, who is grateful to be inside and willing to accept any love shown to him. He has met many people, tons of dogs and one sassy cat, and each time he is polite, calm and friendly. He gently wrestles with our high energy dog, but ultimately loves to flop over on his back during play and just wiggle on the ground. He does not resource guard but he is food motivated for training, and he walks well on leash. He doesn’t bark inside and will generally only bark outside if left alone, he for the most part just wants his human close by. He is willing to cuddle, but could easily be trained to stay off furniture as for the most part he just lays on the floor or his dog bed. Again he is calm with cats!! He shows mild interest in our cat but responds well to being redirected or even disciplined by the cat.i would recommend a slow introduction to be safe, but he is very gentle and just a giant lovable oaf. He has also played well and been friendly with every dog he has been introduced to. As a large unfixed male, this was something we were worried about initially, but as with everything else he has exceeded our expectations. And he will be fixed soon, so that will likely calm him even more.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Sully could do well in any environment but I believe his perfect home would be him with a kind family that maybe has a pet or two for him to be friends with. He would love a home where people are around and spending time with him or bringing him out on lots of walks. He deserves to be around people and loved and spoiled every day. Sully would not do well in a home where he is kept outside or as more of an outdoor dog, as he is a prince and deserves to be treated as such.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>He is about 2 years old, in good health but heart worm positive. He is fully house trained, good with dogs and cats, children unknown but I have a strong sense he would be as gentle with them as every other person he has met. He is medium to low energy, but likes to play, and is opening up more everyday. So far he doesn’t jump or lick and has very good manners meeting new people. He is a great dog who deserves a very loving family</p>",

Cream Puff, aka Duckie, is a sweet little guy who has short little legs and a big personality. His hobbies include playing with his foster siblings, sassing cats, carrying around toys nearly as big as he is, and cuddling. If you want a dog equal parts energetic and snuggly, this little duckling would be perfect!&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>He's very good with other dogs, plays well and shares toys and loves to play tug. He also enjoys going off by himself to chew on a favorite toy (Lamb Chop is currently his emotional support stuffy). He's curious about cats, and loves to bark and sass at them, from a safe distance of course. He's great with potty pads, and will go on them if they're available, and he's also doing great at going potty outside in the yard, especially if there are other dogs to show him where to go. He's very bright and picks up on things quickly, and is very treat/food motivated, so training will likely be a breeze!</p><p><br></p><p>And let's get back to that mention of cuddling - Cream Puff is a GREAT snuggler. Once he settles down for a nap or overnight, he loves to be plastered right up against a human or a dog friend. He also sleeps really well overnight, and if you're looking for a snuggly dog to sleep in your bed at night, he's definitely your guy!&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Cream Puff would love to go to a home with some dog friends to play with!</p>",

He's a lively little ball of energy just waiting to burst out of his cozy kennel, and he adores EVERYONE without exception. At home, he'll be your charming entertainer, plus he has the added perk of keeping you informed about incoming guests and package deliveries. He previously shared his home with an older, large Labrador retriever who has sadly passed away. He dutifully enjoys his baths and nail trims, knows a few commands, never turns down a treat, and spends a lot of his time winning hearts.</span></p>",

She's still likely to hiss if approached too quickly and be tightened up as hard as a rock when you touch her, but with some dedication I have gotten her to start relaxing during pets and even put her chin up and press into some neck and chin scritches. Definitely can't pick her up with your hands, but placing a blanket or towel over her makes her limp enough to handle and transport her. I believe she can be domesticated and put into a good home, but it will take continued work. Named Persephone because I got two kittens from her the year before these four kittens, so she was like Persephone coming back from the underworld every year bringing me new pretty babies. She has now been spayed to end that cycle!</p>",
