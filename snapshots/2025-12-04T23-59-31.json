    "description_html": "<p>Who loves movie night?! Jade does and she's looking for a couch potato buddy. She's also the hostess with the mostest - she loves having people over and is great at making sure everyone feels welcome! Her foster friends say, \"Jade is house trained and low key in the house. She is not destructive &amp; can be left alone, and she enjoys cuddling but is not super pushy. This girl loves to nap and loves to eat! AKA she is super easy to please. She also sleeps through the night like a gem and has to be woken up by her humans for breakfast. Jade lived with a toddler for 2 weeks and was incredibly gentle. Jade loves to sunbathe and chill in the backyard. She gets excited to zoom around when given the opportunity, but then reverts back to her calm, cuddly self in the house. Jade's only \"difficult\" trait, which I assume is the reason she has yet to be adopted, is that she does need to be in an only pet home. However, with a family with a yard and no other pets, she would be the easiest dog ever and best companion!\"</p>",

Teddy lived in an apartment with a foster and demonstrated great home skills. He's fully housetrained and was walked 4 times a day at a nearby park. He met a lot of new people along the way and he always accepts every affection that is being offered. And bonus, he's not a big barker at home either so pretty perfect if you share walls with others. He made an excellent quiet and calm co-worker. Teddy Bear is ready to go wherever you would like to take him, take him to the couch for a movie, on a run, for a hike, to a park or just into your own yard space. He even entertains himself with his toys and balls and by the way, he loves water play and any size pool. All of this, and the best smiles you can ever imagine, are yours just for the asking. Don't pass him over. Try him out. Go ahead, make him your social media star - he would love that. He's advocated for by his friends at ClassicCaninesATX who help the mature dog crowd stand out as the best of the best. A mature dog that knows the ropes in life is a perfect choice for so many lifestyles and people of all ages. Let him show you. Have a resident doggo? Setup a doggie meet and greet.</p>",

He has most of the fundamentals they just need to be dialed in, including recall and leash skills.

He interacts great with other dogs and people, but the first two minutes can be puppy intensive. He loves car rides in the wind in his face playing with his friends and walks. If allowed, he'll join you on the couch or in bed but he's not needy or a pest. He does the pitbull proud and has broken down some  stereotypes for the people around him and eats carrots and apples. No experiences with cats or kids under six.\r\n\r\nA little more about Mumbai is that he is crate trained, but I found it to be unnecessary as he's not destructive.

He’s a classic velcro dog who wants nothing more than to be near his person—curled up in bed at night, tagging along during the day, and gently nudging in for affection whenever you’re open to it.</p><p>He’s incredibly social and gives out happy face-licks to both people and friendly dogs who welcome them. Playtime is his love language, and his tail is pretty much always wagging. Ralph is also bright and responsive—he learned “go to your crate” and “sit” almost instantly and genuinely enjoys learning new things.</p><p><strong>A few things to know so you can set him up for success:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Toy sharing:</strong> Ralph thinks toys are treasures and may snatch one from another dog. He’ll shine in a home with no other dogs <em>or</em> with dogs who are very relaxed about sharing.</li><li><strong>Leash manners:</strong> He’s making great progress! He’s gone from steady pulling to frequently checking in with his handler. He may still pull toward dogs on walks, but he’s improving with practice.</li><li><strong>Alert barking:</strong> Ralph will let you know if someone is nearby—people, dogs, critters. If you like a built-in alert system, he’s your guy.</li></ul><p><strong>If you’re looking for…</strong></p><ul><li>a cheerful, cuddly “shadow” who bonds deeply</li><li>a fast learner who loves training</li><li>a dog who will brighten your days with play, affection, and unfiltered loyalty</li><li>a buddy who prefers either being your one-and-only or living with dogs who don’t mind sharing toys</li></ul><p>…then Ralph might be exactly who you’ve been waiting for.</p><p><strong>He’s ready to be someone’s best friend.

    "description_html": "Geedorah (GeeGee for short) has the most striking eyes. Combine those eyes with fun merle spots on her head and she's one beautiful pup!\r\n\r\nThis sweet gal starts out a little shy then really starts to shine once she gets to know you, accepting gentle pets and nicely taking treats. GeeGee loves other dogs-she immediately became fast friends with her foster brother, running around the backyard and playing. She likes but is also respectful of her two elderly, smaller foster sisters when they don't want to play. She was a little interested in her foster guinea pig siblings at first, but once they were shown to her up close, she lost interest. So no problem for her if there are small animals in the house.\r\n\r\nMiss GeeGee is a smart cookie. She learned the dog door in two days from watching her siblings. She's also crate trained and is comfortable in her crate overnight or during the day when her people are at work.\r\n\r\nIf you like walks, this girl can be your best buddy! She easily keeps up with her foster mom for 2-3 miles. GeeGee is also happy to chill with her family. She's really starting to enjoy and seek out couch cuddles both with her people and her foster siblings. The middle of a cuddle puddle is now one of her favorite spots! Geedorah can also entertain herself with toys (stuffies and ropes) and chew treats like benebones. Since she's four years old, she's past the crazy puppy energy but still has many years to love her forever family.\r\n\r\nAt a compact 35 pounds, Geedorah is the perfect size for any household. Come meet this amazing girl and fall in love with your new best friend!\r\n\r\nCheck out Geedorah's Instagram: @adopt_GeeGee_dog",

    "description_html": "He's potty trained and sleeps well in a crate overnight. He got his first bath today and did very well!\r\n\r\nHe's VERY vocal which we are fine with, but his bark/ talking/ howl is very loud and a little startling. He responds to \"quiet\" and settles down.\r\n\r\nHe's still very hesitant of physical touch and will not easily come to us or allow us to pet him, but it's getting better every day! He's nervous around any new people, but is not aggressive at all! He just likes to tell the new people (aka bark) at them to keep their distance. We have not tried a walk yet bc it's hard to get close enough to get a harness on, but we plan to tackle that soon. He's very food motivated, so training with treats will be easy.\r\n\r\nJack does really well with our dogs! We have a German shepherd and a dachshund. Good to know he does well with dogs of all sizes. He doesn't ask to play a ton, but when they get to playing he wants to join in. He responds well when they set boundaries and he also will set a boundary when needed. He hasn't quite figured out fetch, but he enjoys chasing our dog when he plays fetch.\r\n\r\nHe's not as energetic as other puppies we've had which might make him a good fit for an older adopter or someone that can't be home all the time. Bc of his barking and size I don't think he'd be a great apartment dog. He does love to wander the backyard and do a lot of sniffing.\tNo\r\n",

My foster parents gave me that name since I spent my life being so powerless, now it is my time to learn what it's like to have power. I had a very rough first half of life, and am ready to be loved. I finished all of my medical treatment and am a very healthy boy. I am starting to realize the world isn't so scary. I am still a bit nervous, but love being pet and chilling out with a chew stick. I like to stay glued to someone's leg when I am on the leash and am great about going to the bathroom outside. My foster cat and dog brothers are both spooky to me even when they stand still so I ignore them. My foster rabbit brother isn't as scary to me though.

At two years old, this cuddlebug and zoomie enthusiast is soaking up every bit of life on the outside—and he’s ready to share it all with his forever family.</p><p>Dandy is a social pup who loves chasing balls, splashing in a kiddie pool, going for walks, and tagging along on whatever adventure the day brings. When it’s time to relax, he’s all about the snuggles—curling up beside you and soaking in the love like it’s his favorite treat.</p><p>He gets along well with other dogs and thrives with a little mealtime structure—currently enjoying his meals in a quiet spot to help him feel calm and secure. After eating, he heads out for a quick potty break before jumping back into the fun. He’s doing wonderfully with potty training, going up to 8 hours accident-free during the day and even longer overnight. He sleeps soundly on a couch, dog bed, or right next to you if invited.</p><p>Dandelion walks beautifully on a harness and shorter leash, exploring the world at your side with curiosity and calm. He’s smart, eager to engage, and channels his energy into all the right things—like enrichment toys, frozen carrots, stuffed Kongs, Chuck-It balls, and durable chews. He redirects easily and is always up for learning.</p><p>Because of an old vocal cord injury, Dandy doesn’t bark loudly—but he makes up for it with happy wiggles, soulful eyes, and gentle energy that speaks volumes. He’ll thrive with continued consistency, love, and either leashed adventures or a secure yard to safely enjoy the outdoors.</p><p>Dandelion is that rare blend of fun-loving and affectionate, making him the perfect hiking buddy, poolside pal, and loyal snuggle partner. He’s bloomed beautifully—now all he needs is a home where he can keep growing, loved and safe.</p><p>\n</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); background-color: rgb(247, 247, 252);\">If you have any questions, please reach out to&nbsp;</span><a href=\"mailto:orangedotcrew@gmail.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">orangedotcrew@gmail.com</a><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); background-color: rgb(247, 247, 252);\">&nbsp;to kickstart this heartwarming journey.

He loves his volunteer friends so much, and even though he's a little shy, he really opens up with big smiles and full-booty wags when he gets leashed up for his favorite walks. And boy does he love walking around the fields at the shelter. He takes it all in and exudes joy when he's exploring the great outdoors with his human buddies. He is super-duper house-trained, so his fans make sure he gets out twice a day. He keeps his kennel very clean, and he is willing to wait all day long to do his business! In the play yard, Iced Tea loves chasing toys and can entertain himself for hours with balls and stuffies. He may seem timid at first, but he goes into full puppy mode when he's in a yard. We should also mention that Iced Tea is stunningly handsome (duh!) with his shiny, sandy-colored coat that sheds very little. What more could you ask for in a lifelong best friend? As with so many of our pups here at the shelter, he has a very sad backstory, and we would love to see him have a very happy ending. Adopt&nbsp;Iced Tea&nbsp;at Austin Animal Center!</p>",

    "description_html": "Meet Daisy Mae, a heartwarming, sweet soul who's slowly finding her way through the world with the love and patience of her foster family. Although she is an incredibly kind-hearted dog, she is also deeply fearful-particularly of people, leashes, cats, and certain confined spaces. Her past experiences have made her wary of many things, but despite this, she's never shown aggression. Instead, she prefers to quietly retreat and observe.\r\n\r\nSince forming a bond with her humans, Daisy Mae has become more affectionate, seeking out cuddles and pets, her heartwarming way of expressing her trust. She absolutely loves her many toys, hoarding them with pride, and she enjoys playful games of chase in the backyard, where she feels most at peace basking in the sun. She has no interest in escaping or digging out of the yard-she is perfectly content in her outdoor haven.\r\n\r\nWhile she can be timid around new people, her interactions with other dogs have been positive-she's not reactive and even got along well with a calm Pug who came to visit. Though she doesn't yet feel fully comfortable indoors due to her fear of cats, she finds her solace on the deck, wrapped in blankets, and curled up on a whelping pad. Despite her fears, she's shown remarkable resilience, and though her journey is still unfolding, she's already made great strides toward trust and comfort.\r\n\r\nDaisy Mae is a work in progress-an endearing, shy companion learning to embrace love and connection at her own pace.",

She’s smart, sassy, and her endearing personality has amassed her a whole fan club of volunteers at the shelter. Once you’re in Loretta’s circle, you’re in for life — she’ll shower you with love, loyalty, and a few dramatic head tilts for good measure.</p><p>\n</p><p>Loretta recently went on a field trip and had an absolute blast: she played with toys, had her own spa day with a bath, strutted her stuff in the backyard like it was Paris Fashion Week, and rode in the car like a curious co-pilot. She insisted on sitting upright to look out the windshield — because, of course, the star needs to see where the chauffeur is taking her.</p><p>\n</p><p>She’s also a smart cookie! During a sleepover with a volunteer, Loretta showed she’s quickly picking up on house training, is crate trained, and loves having a comfy spot to curl up after a day of adventures.</p><p>\n</p><p>If you’re looking for a dog who will make you laugh every day, love you endlessly, and add a little sparkle (and sass) to your life, Loretta is your girl.</p>",

With gentle structure and patient, kind humans, he thrives. He loves cheese-based positive reinforcement, cuddle research, and checking whether his people are still within a 20-foot radius.</p><p>If your love language is steady affection and snack-based encouragement, you might just be Toby’s perfect co-researcher.</p><p>👉 Toby’s eligible for <strong>VIP Adoption</strong>, which includes a 30-day trial at home — your chance to run your own heart experiment.</p><p>If you have any questions, please reach out to orangedotcrew@gmail.com to kickstart this heartwarming journey.

While volunteers had him in a big play yard filled with toys and even a pool, he chose to hang out with the people, instead of exploring all the fun stuff around him. It really shows how much he values human connections. It's time to catch up for a few lost years and have a simpler dogs' life as part of the indoor family. Ready to lift a guy up to a new level of existence? He's also starting to test out dog play groups, and is sharing his kennel space with a calm shepherd lady who respects his space. Overall, Santiago is an easy-going buddy who's easy to please and engage with, and one you know you will be making a difference in the life of. Come check him out. He's advocated for by his friends and fans including ClassicCaninesATX.",

She's spent the last few months on an amazing journey back to wellness, and to increased mobility. Bunny can now do everything that dogs do - besides being a great guest at home, she's house trained, she enjoys a little yard time and sunshine on her face. Short walks for exercise help her muscle strength. She's also a fish while guided in a swimming pool. She gives and receives so many affections. She's earned a reputation as a lap dog.</p><p><br></p><p>Bunny has a condition that makes her wobbly and unsteady on her feet, but she is aided by standard traction helpers like rugs, mats and being on flat surfaces when outdoors. Her Help Em Up harness also makes things a whole lot easier to guide her when needed. Bunny will do best in a single story arrangement as an only animal in her home.</p><p><br></p><p>Bunny's care includes occasional skin and eye management, and keeping her muscles in good tone. Her advocates at ClassicCaninesATX have been providing her care at an outside clinic and will help with supplies and some future veterinary care funding for an adopter.</p><p><br></p><p>Are you ready to make a difference in the life of a lady that has come this far already to prepare to meet you?

I wasn’t doing laps, but I enjoyed splashing and walking around in the water.

He’s a soft, gentle player with other dogs and loves making new human friends—especially if belly rubs are on the table!</p><p>This charming boy recently had a field trip to a foster home and absolutely nailed it. He was completely house-trained (not a single accident!), respectful indoors, and settled in beautifully. His one hilarious misstep?

No repeats, just good boy energy from then on.</p><p>He explored the home calmly, played with <em>every</em> squeaky toy, and then curled up on the couch for a cozy nap. When a familiar friend came to visit, Chicharrón greeted her with happy wiggles and calm excitement—clearly a dog who knows how to balance joy and manners.</p><p>He also did great in the car, hopping right in, entertaining himself with toys in the backseat, and taking in the world through the window with quiet curiosity.</p><p>Chicharrón is the total package: house-savvy, leash-lovin’, toy-obsessed, and full of affection.

    "description_html": "Would you like to adopt a very special cat? Roo is definitely special, and worth a little extra effort. She has a neurological condition that affects her balance and coordination (she wobbles when she walks). We believe that Roo was born with this condition, and it will probably not worsen or improve with time. She requires a large litterbox so that she doesn't miss (her foster dad customized one, and it goes with her when she's adopted). \r\n\r\nRoo is an extremely happy, affectionate cat. She is playful (her fave is a wand toy), and she loves nothing more than to be in a lap and snuggle. She walks around well on tile floors, but she does best on carpeting. She can't jump or climb, so a low window that she can look out would be ideal.\r\n\r\nI am a DHC, and I have my own webpage: http://www.desperatehousecats.info/flyers/Roo7099.pdf\r\n\r\nThe adoption fee is waived for Roo and all Desperate Housecats!\r\n",

Staff removed the tapes and he walked gingerly for a few days while his paws were treated. We don't know why the tapes were there. Every day since he's been his friendly happy self at his kennel gate, waiting for visitors in an expansive kennel but the constant standing and wagging of his tail right behind his door, close to a side wall, has led to a bit of a happy tail. It's been getting battered more and more. Now he's been neutered so he can have dog meet ups. Now we think he's ready for a friend for the first time. But more findings came from his neuter: \"Rads show old possible left femoral neck fracture and definite hip dysplasia left side now. Also has severe lumbo-sacral spondylosis.</p><p>\n</p><p>With this news, we know how urgent our efforts need to be be find home comforts for our friend Pax.</p><p>\n</p><p>We believed he was about 8 yrs old but he is wearing so much more trauma and aging on his body. In spite of it all, he still loves to be active, roll in the grass and play with toys.</p><p>\n</p><p>Are you ready to make a difference in the life of a dog that desperately needs to have some time living a normal dogs life for a change? Can you give our Paxton a chance to experience life as it was meant to be?</p><p>\n</p><p>His advocates at caring@classiccanines.org offer special support for adopters of dogs 7 and up, and he is also available for foster.

    "description_html": "<p>Bourdain has already survived a lot. Found on limping on the side of the road, x-rays revealed bullet fragments in his leg and chest, but you’d never know it from how joyfully he lives each day.</p><p>He’s playful, silly, and full of personality. In the play yard, Bourdain turns fetch into an art form — sometimes carrying two toys at once, just because he can (he's a big boy at 76 pounds). Volunteers call him “ridiculously cute” and say he’s happiest leaning in for scratches between rounds of play.</p><p>Bourdain can get a little over-excited sometimes, so he’ll need an adult-only home with a patient adopter who can give him some structure. He will need a meet and greet with any resident pups, but his playful, curious side really shines through once he feels secure.</p><p>If you have any questions, please reach out to orangedotcrew@gmail.com to kickstart this heartwarming journey.

    "description_html": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">Sweet, silly, and affectionate, Ellie is the most beautiful golden girl looking for a soft place to land and a family to call her own. On the labrador retriever color spectrum, one might say she lands somewhere between \"lightly toasted\" and \"golden.\" She has the most adorable ears (one that sticks up and the other that flops over) and the cutest docked tail. She is currently housed with an older, mellow dog and a younger, active dog. She is a fantastic dog friend because she knows how to match the energy and respect the boundaries of anyone she plays with. Ellie is house-trained, a loose-leash walker, quiet (not a big barker from what her foster parents can&nbsp;tell), doesn't get on furniture unless invited, is non-destructive when left alone in the home, and sleeps well throughout the night. When out and about she has met babies, toddlers, teens, and seniors, and has done well with everyone. Her favorite things include walks, napping, car rides, playing, and belly rubs! If you decide to stop petting her, be prepared for her to politely ask for \"more pets, please!\" Ellie is not a fan of rabbits, cats, closed doors in confining spaces, loud sudden&nbsp;noises, or flags flapping in the breeze.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">Because not a whole lot is known about her past, Ellie can still be shy in new situations and around people she doesn't know. In these situations, usually a high-value treat and a little patience goes a long way to winning her over. Ellie would thrive in a home where she can demand all the belly rubs her heart desires, and a cozy place to curl up. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">Click \"Get Started\" to connect with this beautiful pup in person!</span></p>",

Happy to chill by your side while you work or watch TV? Full of personality and gets along with other dogs? Then Mr. Franco might just be your unicorn! At around 7 months old and already tipping the scales at over 50 pounds, Franco is a big-hearted goofball who doesn't quite realize his own size. He's the perfect mix of cuddly and calm, with bursts of excited energy when it's time to play, especially with people, pups, or when there's food involved. Franco is currently in foster care, where he's working hard on his recall, patience, and manners. Like many tall boys, he's been known to counter-surf, but his foster mom assures us: \"We're working on it!\" Hand him a toy or a bone, and Franco's in heaven. 🏡 Ideal Home: Franco will thrive in a home that can offer him a balance of activity and downtime-think daily walks or dog park play, followed by some solid couch cuddles. Due to his size and puppy energy, we recommend a home without cats and without very young children, unless they're experienced with dogs.</p>",

    "description_html": "<p>Meet Buddy, a very respectful young (1.5 year old) boy now living with a 17lb doddle mix and a 40lb lab mix. Though he likes being around his dog companions he really enjoys being around kids playing outside. Game of fetch or just about any other game is ok with Buddy. Inside, he is calm and surrounds himself with as many squeak toys as possible. Though a young boy, he spends most of the day chilled with afternoons reserved for a long siesta. No problems with deer just outside the fence but the occasional squirrel will grab his attention. Though Buddy spends most of the day inside given the high outdoor temps, in the evening and early morning he enjoys being outside watching the world pass. The highlight of the day is his walk. His lease etiquette is being worked on but drastically improved over a short period of time (about 70% there). Buddy understands and obeys basic commands (stay, sit, laydown, off). If he does become excited inside, a simple command to laydown works every time. He is very respectful of the two other dogs living in the house even the little one who often try's to dominate. Too, it's amazing how little he sheds, especially compared to the other two we have but this could change throughout the year. Overall a very obedient calm boy who would love to have someone to play or spend time outside.</p>",

When he first arrived at the shelter, he was completely shut down — scared, unsure, and desperate for comfort. He didn’t want anyone to leave his side, clinging to human connection as his anchor in a confusing world.</p><p>But oh, how far he’s come.</p><p>Thanks to patience, love, and his own incredible spirit, Mr. Shrimp's confidence has bloomed. He’s now a playful, affectionate, and curious companion who checks in often to make sure he’s being the <em>very best boy</em>. Whether it’s cuddling close, romping around with toys, or soaking up praise for his leash manners, he’s all about making you smile.</p><p>Mr. Shrimp is also impressively house trained and eager to learn the ropes of life outside the shelter. He’s the kind of dog who makes you feel special, just by choosing to trust you.</p><p>This brave little guy is ready for his next adventure — could it be with you?</p><p><span style=\"background-color: rgb(247, 247, 252); color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">If you have any questions, please reach out to&nbsp;</span><a href=\"mailto:orangedotcrew@gmail.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">orangedotcrew@gmail.com</a><span style=\"background-color: rgb(247, 247, 252); color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">&nbsp;to kickstart this heartwarming journey.

    "description_html": "Per Disco's previous foster:\r\n\r\nDisco is a sweet, smart & lovable 1.5 year old pup who can be energetic and playful yet mellow when just hanging out. He is crate & potty trained, and does very well just sitting on the porch or while we watch tv!\r\n\r\nHe's very well behaved, knows \"sit\", \"down\", \"stay\", & \"place\" (his crate & bed). He loves tug of war, hide & seek, and long morning & evening walks. Still a young pup, he needs long walks & play time to tire out his mind & body - we've been walking around 3-4 miles a day!\r\n\r\nAlthough he does get very excited on walks & pulls a bit to sniff all the smells, & play with all the dogs (usually he can walk past with some peaked interest, but sometimes he does get real excited and itches to play with a very light whine and jump - were working on his focus & distractions with treats + positive reinforcement when he looks up at us or checks in) with some consistent training & socialization I'm certain he'd keep his attention at bay in no time! \r\n\r\nDespite his happy go lucky spirit, Disco also knows how to chill at home. He's easy to get in his crate, will sleep next to you for hours during a mellow day, and overall just loves laying down close to people.\r\n\r\nHe's just about 50lbs and shouldn't grow much more, so he's perfect to take in the car (his car manners are perfect) and on adventures!\r\n\r\nDisco would be a wonderful fit for an active home willing to dedicate some time towards cuddles, tug-of-war, + a little bit of discipline & consistency!\r\n",

    "description_html": "<p>Bear offers the best of both worlds! He is the definition of a snuggle bud. He's great on a leash and loves car rides (hello, hiking buddy!), but he's also perfectly content to relax at home. His calm, chill demeanor makes him an easy and wonderful companion.</p><p>Bear is highly food motivated, eager to please, and learns commands lightning-fast. Best of all, once he's comfortable, he’s a massive lovebug who insists on being your little small spoon for every snuggle session! Bear is crate trained and doing fantastic with his house training.</p><p>\n</p><p>Instagram: @adopt_bestboybear.</p><p>\n</p><p>What Bear Needs:</p><p>Bear is a star when he's out on walks—totally non-reactive and composed around people! However, because he hasn't always been treated kindly, he needs slow, thoughtful introductions to new faces trying to pet him as he's still learning that not all new humans want to hurt him. We are actively working with a professional trainer, using positive reinforcement, to help him trade fearful memories for happy ones. Bear happily takes treats from people and can chill while you have a conversation.</p><p>\n</p><p>Dog Friends: He's dog-friendly and would love to live with a confident dog(s) who can help boost his own bravery. He currently resides with 2 small dogs and 2 cats!</p><p>\n</p><p>An Adult-Only, Cat-Free Home: Bear is not ready for kids rushing him and would most likely prefer a home without cats. However, he currently lives with cats in a small home and we feel in the right environment they could eventually coexist.</p><p>\n</p><p>He is currently undergoing heartworm treatment, but his foster can provide all the details on his path to a full recovery! This treatment can be transferred to the adopter at no charge.</p><p>\n</p><p>Follow Bear’s journey and get to know him better on Instagram: @adopt_bestboybear. You can also check out his brother Teddy who is up for adoption too!</p>",

She's great with other dogs (a meet-and-greet is advised) and is a very easy passenger in the car. This pup loves to play, especially chasing balls, and is <em>always</em> ready for food and treats. She's working on enjoying walks; she much prefers the comfy life of a home, but is slowly making progress! Sadie would love a secure yard for her happy zoomies.</p><p>Ready to welcome this professional snuggler into your life?</p>",

Nova's favorite things are taking walks with her people, chasing balls, playing with squeaky toys, and enjoying a chew toy. Nova has lived with small and large dogs previously. She's awaiting her new home today!</p><p>\n</p><p><u>From her foster parents: </u></p><p>\n</p><p>Nova is an extremely sweet and curious dog who loves to be involved in every single conversation and is always eager to receive cuddles and praise. She loves eating kibbles and will drink lots of water when she's thirsty after long walks! She can be a little picky about her treats – for instance, she does not love peanut butter treats so you may need to experiment. Nova is shockingly tolerating of baths, but she does not love getting her paws and eyes cleaned.</p><p>\n</p><p>Nova loves running after balls but does not yet know how to retrieve them (maybe you can teach her!). She loves cars and car rides, and she is learning not to jump and lick when she is excited (to see you!). She may proudly carry your socks to you as a gift, and we still don't know why! She loves to sleep with you but can be trained not to if you don't want her on the bed. She is a little apprehensive of kids and may bark if they get too close. Nova is also protective of you and will bark at strangers in your home, but she becomes friendly when you tell her it's okay. She cares a lot about her people and will run over to help if you seem unwell. </p><p>\n</p><p>Nova loves going on walks but is also very happy to stay home (where she naps and plays). She will run over and sit whenever she hears you pick up the leash! She is also really good at 'sit', especially if you have treats. She is super smart, so with lots of praises and treats, she can learn many more commands! She is very curious and will sniff most things unless it's a mop – in which case she will hide behind you because she is scared of mops!</p><p>\n</p><p>She loves following you around the house, but is not anxious to be by herself at home and responds very calmly to being in the crate. When we are outside, Nova makes sure that everyone is included, rushing home whenever someone is left behind! If she does not see you, she may also check every single car in the garage to make sure that you are not in there :)</p>",

    "description_html": "<h3>Meet Clara Bow (aka Bowie)</h3><p>Hi, I’m <strong>Clara Bow</strong>, but my friends call me <strong>Bowie</strong> - because I’m full of star power and a little bit of sparkle! I’m a young, happy girl (about 70 lbs) who loves people, other dogs, and pretty much everything about life. I bring sunshine wherever I go.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>My Favorite Things</h3><p>I’m <strong>house-trained</strong>, love <strong>walks</strong>, <strong>car rides</strong>, and <strong>playing with my dog friends</strong>. I get along great with both dogs and cats (yep, I’m that well-rounded). During the day, I like to explore, play with toys, or hang out with my foster brother. At night, I’ll curl up next to you - I’m a world-class snuggler.</p><p><br></p><h3>My Personality</h3><p>I’ve got that <strong>fun, goofy, young dog energy</strong>, so I’m looking for a family who is able to spend time with me to play. Whether it's with walks, yard time, adventures (bars, coffee shops pet stores, and playing tug-of-war, or another dog, I love living life and exploring. I’m working on my commands and doing great, but I’m young, curious, and sometimes a little “mouthy” when I get excited (never aggressive - just young dog enthusiasm). A patient person that has experience with dogs would be great. I also think I'd be ok with a family that has older kids! I have experience with my foster mom's nieces and nephews who are really young, so that could work too but older kids will be better able to help train me :)</p><p><br></p><h3>My Quirks (aka My Charms)</h3><p>Like any dog who’s had to look out for herself, I <em>really</em> love food. Mealtime is the best part of my day, and sometimes I like to “help” by checking if you’ve dropped anything tasty when you're eating. I’ve also been known to “borrow” things around the house - socks, shoes, pens, you name it - just for fun and to see if they're edible. Everyone needs a hobby, right?</p><p><br></p><h3>What I’m Looking For</h3><p>I’d love a forever home with someone who:</p><ul><li>Has experience with dogs is a must!</li><li>Can spend time playing with me</li><li>Ideally has another dog friend for me to romp around with</li><li>Preferably has a house with a yard or works from home if they're in an apartment. Someone who can dedicate the first couple of weeks to making sure I know you're coming back.*</li></ul><p><br></p><p>*I was adopted once before for just a day, but was returned. I got really scared when I found myself alone in a brand new apartment and without my dog friend. I barked a lot because I didn’t understand what was happening. My adopter worked in an office four days a week and lived in an apartment, so they were worried about that. I don't do this with my current family who has a house and a cat/dog, but if adopted I just need someone patient who understands that adjusting takes me a little time, but once I feel at home I become confident.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">If you’re looking for a loyal, funny, affectionate companion who’ll make every day brighter, </span><strong style=\"background-color: transparent;\">I might just be your Bowie!</strong></p>",

    "description_html": "<p>Lola is an absolute angel, with ears as big as her heart! She was found at a homeless encampment, looking for love, and still on her search today.</p><p><br></p><p>She is potty trained, crate trained, walks great on a leash, is non-reactive on walks/in general, and loves everyone she meets. Lola is an expert cuddler, and although it seems she has not had any prior formal training, she is incredibly smart and food motivated (AKA the perfect training combo!) She is also the perfect passenger (backseat) princess on car rides, and is just building up the courage to jump in the car by herself. She would love a yard for sunbathing, but is currently doing great in an apartment and will go stand by the door to let you know she wants to get her steps in, or work on her tan! As a younger dog, she loves and needs her long walks and play time, however, she has great inside manners and mostly naps while indoors.</p><p><br></p><p>She is currently the only dog, in a child-free home, but her gentle, friendly, and tolerant personality leads me to believe that she has the potential to live with young human and animal companions— After a meet and greet of course!</p><p><br></p><p>Lola is an amazing dog that has shockingly been overlooked in the shelter, but her time in foster has revealed so many amazing qualities! If you are interested in Lola, or want to hear more about her infinite list of adorable quirks and positive traits, please reach out for more information!</p>",

    "description_html": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Penny, aka Pretty Penny, was born to love and be loved. She has two modes: Tornado on four legs and couch potato — there is no in between!</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">This 8-month-old, 45-lb German Shepherd mix is a delightful blend of playful, goofy, and sweetly clingy. She’s clumsy in the most endearing way, loves climbing right into your lap (despite being far too big for it), has </span><em style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">zero</em><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> concept of personal space and will definitely stare at you like you’re her favorite person in the world. Personal space? Never heard of it. Whether she’s doing zoomies across the yard or melting into the couch, Penny’s favorite place is wherever </span><em style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">you</em><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> are.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Penny is very food-motivated — and while her attention span might rival that of a gnat (or a chicken nugget 🍗), she’s smart and eager to please. She’s what we like to call a </span><em style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">“pay-me-first”</em><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> type of employee. She knows </span><strong style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">sit</strong><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">, </span><strong style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">look at me</strong><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">, </span><strong style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">paw</strong><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">, and </span><strong style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">lay down</strong><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">, but she expects to see the goods (aka treats) before performing her tricks. The good news? She’s starting to respond to commands without a treat in sight — progress, people!</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">She’s still learning her strength when it comes to jumping up and gentle mouthing during play, so continued guidance will help her polish those puppy manners. She’s house-trained and crate-trained, has never had an accident indoors, and sleeps soundly through the night. She may whine a bit when you leave or head upstairs (she’s just making sure you remember how much she loves you), but she’s improving as she gains confidence and trust.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">She’s shown interest in other dogs and has been friendly with neighborhood pups, though she can get a bit too excited during greetings. Penny would thrive in a home where she gets plenty of attention, consistent training, and space to zoom around.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">She’s a medium-energy girl who needs time to play, but she’s just as happy to curl up beside you for hours. She does have a jealous streak — after all, she believes she’s </span><em style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">the</em><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> star of the household — and her bark is as big as her personality, so a family who can appreciate her “big voice” will fit her best.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">If you’re looking for a loyal, silly, endlessly loving companion who will keep you laughing and your heart full, Pretty Penny might just be your perfect match. 💛</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">She's currently not a big fan of car rides and can only tolerate about 20-minute drives (she gets car sick) but we're hoping she'll be able to work through that as time goes on.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Adoption requirements:</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">💛 Room to play (and zoom)</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">💛 Tolerance for dramatic barking</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">💛 Love for goofy dogs who give 110% in everything they do</span></p>",

Someone taught this sweet baby love, they simply did not have the ability to care for her.</p><p>\n</p><p>She's spayed and heartworm negative. Her weight is perfect. Her matts have been shaved off and for the first time in years she is walking on her real paws, she can feel wind on her skin, her body is capable of full stretches, she can run and fully \"feel\" again. With that comes time to adjust to her new body and touch, requiring understanding, patience and light management by her VIPs. She loves love and has a spirit that will warm your soul, but can be subject to occasional startles--her body is new to her..</p><p>\n</p><p>Lady Pablo seems to be very content near cats.</p><p>She's had limited engagement with dogs and seems to mostly co-exist, although we think she would prefer to have all of the people attention for herself.</p><p>\n</p><p>Her ideal person or people will have some experience with small dogs that need a little extra help and guidance in life, It's her turn to catch up for all the years she's lost out on.</p><p>\n</p><p>Interested in learning more?</p><p>Click on her link to reach her foster parents.</p>",

She completed her spay surgery on 10/29 so she is ready to head to her forever home any day now! Her sweet tortie sister, Sprinkles (17021), is also available for adoption and AAC waives the adoption fee for a second kitten.</span><span style=\"color: white;\">second&nbsp;</span></p>",

She relaxes outside on walks and enjoys snuggling up against her friends. Ask our team about foster or adoption for this special girl.</p>",

Our Veterinary team performed a partial tail amputation when she received her spay surgery, so she is ready to go home today! She wasn't sure she loved being around humans until after she had fully recovered from her surgery and then her true personality was unleashed! She would love a lap/shoulder to cuddle on all day long! She is still a young lady, so will also enjoy lots of play! This sweet little thing is waiting for you!</p>",

From people, he loves pets of any kind, head scratches, belly rubs and laps. He might even chirp for attention. Like all his siblings, he’ll purr before you even pick him up and you can hear him and all of them from across the room. He’s decent about being carried around too. He’s often keenly aware of where you are and watches, ready for attention and sometimes hard to get a picture as he gets up to greet you. He’s often close by to help you find toys under the couch, look in cabinets as he and all his sibs are pretty nosey… and loves to explore too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>During the day, he zooms and plays interchangeably with his sibs and love to wrestle and a couple of his smaller sisters tell him what for but they don’t run. Now that they’re bigger and can give it back. He also loves to play with toys of any kind- string, mice and fast toys like ping-pong balls, rattle mice and loves springs, as do they all. He’s social and doesn’t shy away from new people and relaxes quickly in your lap. He gently hand wrestles when you play with him even for his size, as he nibbles on your fingers. Once he learned about a lap, he’ll peep at your feet to be picked up but he hasn’t jumped up yet. He often sleeps close by, under my chair or under my desk on a blanket near my feet… or he naps/sleeps interchangeably with his sibs. During the day, he sleeps on the sofa with them or high up on the cat tree.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He has a small, soft voice and doesn’t talk much… though he might chirp to say hello when you come close to pet him… so, he might talk more as he grows. He does speak up when it’s meal time. He climbs a tall sisal cat tree well to nap with his sibs as well and scratches a rope tree very well. Like all his sibs, he loves playing in the bathtub. At night, he’ll cuddle up with his siblings on the bed and lately even occasionally sleeping over a leg while I read… and he’s usually gone by dawn off playing. I think he would do fine as a solo kitten for someone who works from home, as he loves attention. He would do very well with any of his siblings- Ash 17076, Cormac 17077, Pumpkin 17078, Wish 17080 or Maple 17081. November is polite and not pushy, and think he would also do very well with a cat or kitten wanting a playmate or even a dog who would like companion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He’s pretty good with the litter box. He’s also pretty good getting his front nails clipped when he’s sleepy. He warms up pretty quickly with new people too and doesn’t shy away. I think he’ll do fine with children once used to their energy. He’s fine w/ my older cat and he’s polite to her, sniffing, etc. I think he would do OK with a dog too once he gets used to them after slow introductions.</p>",

Like all her siblings, she’ll purr big and I can get her to purr by just talking to her as I walk over… and her purr is loud even from across the room. She’s not shy like her sister Wish but very up front and forward for attention but she hasn’t asked for a lap yet and just asks to be picked up by peeping at you and put in your lap.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>During the day, she zooms and plays interchangeably with her sibs and zooms very well. She also loves to play with toys of any kind- string, mice and fast toys like ping-pong balls, rattle mice and loves springs. When she was little, she wasn’t a fan of wrestling with her big brothers but now she holds her own and zooms and wrestles with all her sibs. Once in your lap, she hand-wrestles gently and we play belly tickle often. She’ll walk up for attention but so far hasn’t asked for a lap but will sit still for entire head rubs. She often sleeps close by, under my chair or under my desk on a blanket near my feet… or she naps/sleeps interchangeably with her sibs. During the day, she sleeps on the sofa with them or high up on the cat tree.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She has a small, soft voice and can be slightly chatty at times or she might chirp to say hello when you come close to pet her or talk to her… and she might talk more as she grows. She does speak up a little when it’s meal time. She climbs a tall sisal cat tree well to nap with her sibs as well and scratches a rope tree very well. Like all her sibs, she loves playing in the tub but she’s not big enough to make the jump to the bathroom vanity. At night, she’ll cuddle up with her siblings on the bed for a kitten pile and on occasion will come up to cuddle a little, but not as much as her brother Pumpkin. I think she would do fine as a solo kitten for someone who works from home as she wouldn’t mind getting all your attention. She would do very well with any of her siblings- Ash 17076, Cormac 17077, Pumpkin 17078, November 17079 or Wish 17080. Maple is gentle and polite and think she would also do very well with a cat or kitten who wants a playmate, even a gentle dog for a companion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She’s pretty good with the litter box. She’s pretty good getting her front nails clipped when she’s snoozy. She warms up well to new people too with toys and string. I think she’ll do fine with children once used to their energy. She’s fine w/ my older cat and she’s polite to her, sniffing, etc. I think she would do OK with a dog too after slow introductions.</p>",

If you move slow, she loves pets of any kind, belly rubs and we’re working on laps and she sometimes chirp for attention when you’re close. Like all her siblings, she’ll purr big and I can get her to purr by just talking to her as I walk over… and her purr is loud. Since she’s my shy girl, she’s learning to trust and working on carrying her around. She’ll need a patient person to help her continue to learn to trust and open up. Like her sibs, she loves to explore and play.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>During the day, she zooms and plays interchangeably with her sibs and zooms well. She also loves to play with toys of any kind- string, mice and fast toys like ping-pong balls, rattle mice and loves springs. She’s come a very long way since I first took her in and he’s become far more social and I think she’ll open up more with help. Once in your lap, she hand-wrestles gently and we play belly tickle often. She hasn’t asked for a lap yet but won’t run if you reach for her slowly for a lap. She often sleeps close by, under my chair or under my desk on a blanket near my feet… or she naps/sleeps interchangeably with her sibs. During the day, she sleeps on the sofa with them or high up on the cat tree.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She has a small, soft voice and doesn’t talk much… though she might chirp to say hello when you come close to pet her or talk to her… so, she might talk more as she grows. She does speak up a little when it’s meal time. She climbs a tall sisal cat tree well to nap with her sibs as well and scratches a rope tree very well. Like all her sibs, she loves playing in the tub, joining in on killing the curtain and has graduated up to taking over the bathroom counter. At night, she’ll cuddle up with her siblings on the bed but doesn’t cuddle up more than that… and she’s usually gone by dawn as they play. I think she would do fine as a solo kitten for someone who works from home to give her a safe place to trust. She would do very well with any of her siblings- Ash 17076, Cormac 17077, Pumpkin 17078, November 17079 or Maple 17081. Wish is gentle and polite and think she would also do very well with a cat or kitten who wants a playmate, even a gentle dog for a companion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She’s pretty good with the litter box. She’s pretty good getting her front nails clipped when she’s sleepy. It takes her a little bit to warm to new people too with toys and string. I think she’ll do fine with children once used to their energy. She’s fine w/ my older cat and she’s polite to her, sniffing, etc. I think she would do OK with a dog too after slow introductions.</p>",

If not adopted soon, we'd love to see Crosby in foster care where he can relax and come out of his shell gradually. He will do best in a low traffic, quiet spot with someone who can provide consistent, gentle attempts at interaction while also giving him the space he requests to adapt.</span></p>",

    "description_html": "<p>Sully was found as a stray near the HEB by William cannon and I-35. Not much is known about his life before this moment, but he has made quite the impression in the short time we have had him. From the moment we set eye on him he was a happy gentleman, sitting calmly outside HEB. He accepted food gently, and belly rubs with great enthusiasm. Since that moment Sully has proven to be a mild mannered, medium to low energy dog, who is grateful to be inside and willing to accept any love shown to him. He has met many people, tons of dogs and one sassy cat, and each time he is polite, calm and friendly. He gently wrestles with our high energy dog, but ultimately loves to flop over on his back during play and just wiggle on the ground. He does not resource guard but he is food motivated for training, and he walks well on leash. He doesn’t bark inside and will generally only bark outside if left alone, he for the most part just wants his human close by. He is willing to cuddle, but could easily be trained to stay off furniture as for the most part he just lays on the floor or his dog bed. Again he is calm with cats!! He shows mild interest in our cat but responds well to being redirected or even disciplined by the cat.i would recommend a slow introduction to be safe, but he is very gentle and just a giant lovable oaf. He has also played well and been friendly with every dog he has been introduced to. As a large unfixed male, this was something we were worried about initially, but as with everything else he has exceeded our expectations. And he will be fixed soon, so that will likely calm him even more.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Sully could do well in any environment but I believe his perfect home would be him with a kind family that maybe has a pet or two for him to be friends with. He would love a home where people are around and spending time with him or bringing him out on lots of walks. He deserves to be around people and loved and spoiled every day. Sully would not do well in a home where he is kept outside or as more of an outdoor dog, as he is a prince and deserves to be treated as such.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>He is about 2 years old, in good health but heart worm positive. He is fully house trained, good with dogs and cats, children unknown but I have a strong sense he would be as gentle with them as every other person he has met. He is medium to low energy, but likes to play, and is opening up more everyday. So far he doesn’t jump or lick and has very good manners meeting new people. He is a great dog who deserves a very loving family</p>",

He's geriatric at 9 yrs old, underweight, heart worm positive, he has a dull coarse coat, he's slow to rise, and needs OA meds or supplements, no masses were felt, thank goodness - his conditions all seem very fixable and despite his depleted condition, he's friendly, but shy, he'll lean into you, he loves having a little company for a walk and while he eats his dinner. Can you offer a place to help him recover and get back to his best again? He is available for adoption &amp; foster with medical sponsorship from his advocate team at caring@classiccanines.org-reach out to staff or email for more info.

He clearly has known love and care in his lifetime because his coat is so very soft from good nutrition, and he carries just a couple of extra pounds of good loving. He's also heart worm negative. He's shown us he's very house trained too. It's been an adjustment for him being in a noisy shelter, he would like a little less noise. He's very quiet and watchful, easy to leash up and pass other dogs. He enjoys the comfy bedding and a good chew. He's appreciative of kindness. We would like for him to receive all these things while in a loving home instead of in a shelter. Please come meet your best friend waiting, right here. Meet him onsite or write his advocates with questions at caring@classiccanines.org</p>",

She’s a confident, curious kitten who loves exploring, zooming through her tunnel, dragging toys around, and generally doing whatever she decides is important in the moment.</p><p>She isn’t a constant cuddler, but when she chooses you, she really chooses you. Nova will climb into a lap, curl up beside you, or even stretch out on the family dog if the mood strikes.</p><p>Nova is learning that people and pets are for gentle paws, not nibbling or ear-swatting, and she’s picking it up quickly. She does great with strangers, handles toddler enthusiasm with patience, and is becoming fast friends with a chihuahua after a few opinionated introductions.</p><p>With perfect litter box habits, lots of confidence, and a playful, spirited personality, Nova would thrive in a home that appreciates an independent kitten with charm, energy, and a mind of her own.</p>",
