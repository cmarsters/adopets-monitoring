    "description_html": "<p>Who loves movie night?! Jade does and she's looking for a couch potato buddy. She's also the hostess with the mostest - she loves having people over and is great at making sure everyone feels welcome! Her foster friends say, \"Jade is house trained and low key in the house. She is not destructive &amp; can be left alone, and she enjoys cuddling but is not super pushy. This girl loves to nap and loves to eat! AKA she is super easy to please. She also sleeps through the night like a gem and has to be woken up by her humans for breakfast. Jade lived with a toddler for 2 weeks and was incredibly gentle. Jade loves to sunbathe and chill in the backyard. She gets excited to zoom around when given the opportunity, but then reverts back to her calm, cuddly self in the house. Jade's only \"difficult\" trait, which I assume is the reason she has yet to be adopted, is that she does need to be in an only pet home. However, with a family with a yard and no other pets, she would be the easiest dog ever and best companion!\"</p>",

He's a champion snuggler and TV watcher and would love a spot simply hanging out in a living room.

    "description_html": "<p>Hi! My name is Dietrich. That means \"ruler of the people\" in German. My foster parents gave me that name since I spent my life being so powerless, now it is my time to learn what it's like to have power. I had a very rough first half of life, and am ready to be loved. I was once emaciated but no more, thanks to the shelter and my foster people. My spirits have been lifted, I'm realizing the world isn't so scary, I just needed a different view of it. I am still a bit nervous, but I love affections, having a good chew and I'm learning not to be afraid of my dog, cat and bunny siblings because they are family and that's new for me to learn. I didn't get to be part of a family before..</p><p>Just as I was on my way to my very best, I'm having a tricky nasal problem that may be caused by a fungus or a mass - I hope you'll follow my story on the pages of ClassicCaninesATX or at caring@classiccanines.org - the advocacy group is covering my care for testing, diagnosis and seeking my treatment needs. I'm really grateful for the new life I have that opened my eyes and heart to love, compassion and belonging like family. Please support my efforts so I can have as much life ahead as possible. I found a whole new world I didn't know about before.</p><p><br></p>",

He's living in a foster home where he's proven to be very housetrained, for a full work day. He enjoys the security of his crate sometimes  and isn't anxious at all to be left alone and simply sleeps the time away. He does enjoy sleeping by his person if allowed. He likes baths and has learned a love of some toys and short zoomie sessions in the yard. He's been a joy for his foster to watch unfold now that he doesn't have to figure out the basics of life for himself. Reach out to learn more. He's had some light experience around dogs including a smaller dog, and has not yet met cats. A meet and greet with a resident dog can be scheduled at the shelter.

He sleeps soundly on a couch, dog bed, or right next to you if invited.</p><p>Dandelion walks beautifully on a harness and shorter leash, exploring the world at your side with curiosity and calm.

Even so, Toby has stayed gentle, sweet, and openly loving. When he gets out of the kennel, you can see how much he wants to connect—leaning in for chest rubs, staying close, and soaking up attention.</p><p>Like many sensitive, social dogs, Toby finds the shelter overwhelming at times. With limited chances to decompress, he can try to fit a lot of love into short moments. With calm humans and time to settle, Toby softens, relaxes, and becomes an easy, cuddly companion who takes his cues from the people around him.</p><p>Toby is especially attuned to human energy. He does best with steady, caring people who appreciate a close bond and enjoy a dog who feels deeply and loves fully. In a home, he is house-trained and crate-trained, quiet and respectful, and comfortable being left alone.</p><p>Toby will thrive in a home where he can settle in, feel safe, and be close to his people.</p><p>👉 Toby is eligible for VIP Adoption, which includes a 30-day trial at home—a chance to see how he fits into your life.</p><p>📧 If you have questions, please reach out to <a href=\"mailto:orangedotcrew@gmail.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">orangedotcrew@gmail.com</a> to get started.

Think “Hi!Hi!Hi!Let’sBeBestFriends!” right out of the gate. With proper introductions, he’s thrilled to make doggy friends.</p><p>Despite his playful energy, Benji takes his beauty rest very seriously and fits naps into his daily schedule like a true professional. He is a <strong>HUGE cuddle bug</strong> and firmly believes couches and beds exist <em>specifically</em> for snuggling. On work-from-home days, he’ll either quietly entertain himself or snooze right next to your desk as your emotional support coworker.</p><p>Benji is also a total people-lover. Friends coming over? Best day ever.

When she’s not snuggling, she’s carrying a toy around the yard and making herself laugh — she can play happily on her own and then trot over for more love.</p><p><br></p><p>Zariah walks nicely on leash, is treat-motivated, and appears house-trained. She enjoys the company of other dogs one-on-one but can get a little overwhelmed in bigger groups, so 1 dog sibling (or being the only pet) may suit her best. Thinking about adding her to your family? If you already have a dog at home, you can set up a meet &amp; greet at the shelter to see if it's a good fit.</p><p><br></p><p>Zariah would love a home that offers:</p><p>✔ Snuggle time and affection</p><p>✔ Either no pets or a compatible dog friend</p><p>✔ Toys and enrichment — she lives for them</p><p><br></p><p>This joyful, loving, playful girl just wants a person to adore.</p><p>Come meet Zariah — she melts for anyone willing to lean in.</p>",

She's spent the last few months on an amazing journey back to wellness, and to increased mobility. Bunny can now do everything that dogs do - besides being a great guest at home, she's house trained, she enjoys a little yard time and sunshine on her face. Short walks for exercise help her muscle strength. She's also a fish while guided in a swimming pool. She gives and receives so many affections. She's earned a reputation as a lap dog.</p><p><br></p><p>Bunny has a condition that makes her wobbly and unsteady on her feet, but she is aided by standard traction helpers like rugs, mats and being on flat surfaces when outdoors. Her Help Em Up harness also makes things a whole lot easier to guide her when needed. Bunny will do best in a single story arrangement as an only animal in her home.</p><p><br></p><p>Bunny's care includes occasional skin and eye management, and keeping her muscles in good tone. Her advocates at ClassicCaninesATX have been providing her care at an outside clinic and will help with supplies and some future veterinary care funding for an adopter.</p><p><br></p><p>Are you ready to make a difference in the life of a lady that has come this far already to prepare to meet you? Are you the person who will welcome her to unconditional forever love?

She has a neurological condition that affects her balance and coordination (she wobbles when she walks). We believe that Roo was born with this condition, and it will probably not worsen or improve with time. She requires a large litterbox so that she doesn't miss (her foster dad customized one, and it goes with her when she's adopted). \r\n\r\nRoo is an extremely happy, affectionate cat. She is playful (her fave is a wand toy), and she loves nothing more than to be in a lap and snuggle. She walks around well on tile floors, but she does best on carpeting. She can't jump or climb, so a low window that she can look out would be ideal.\r\n\r\nI am a DHC, and I have my own webpage: http://www.desperatehousecats.info/flyers/Roo7099.pdf\r\n\r\nThe adoption fee is waived for Roo and all Desperate Housecats!\r\n",

He is a good coexister with other dogs, but mostly is focused on humans.&nbsp;He doesn't guard toys, treats, or food. He's very quick to sit when there's treats or food in sight. If you're seeking a loyal, affectionate, and utterly delightful companion to brighten your days, Milton is waiting to steal your heart.&nbsp;Meet him today!</span></p>",

Her ideal family is active or has a backyard that she can run around in.

When we picked her up from AAC, she was shut down and wouldn’t leave the spot by the front door for two days. Now, she cuddles with us, plays tug-of-war with her foster sisters, greets our guests without barking, and has made friends with many of the dogs in our neighborhood. We are sure that this is just the beginning and that she will continue to blossom into a great companion.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>If you’d like to meet Lilly or learn more about her, don’t hesitate to reach out!</p>",

    "description_html": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">After seven months in a kennel, Alfie has had some time in a foster home and is finally discovering what it means to be someone's beloved dog—and he's absolutely flourishing. This handsome, 1.5 year old brindle boy wakes up every morning with pure joy, tail wagging wildly just at the sound of his name. He's still learning how his body works and how big he really is, but his enthusiasm for life and love is undeniable.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Alfie's ideal day includes trail walks at Walnut Creek or Southeast Metropolitan Park, where he'll take his time orienting with a good sniff before settling into a comfortable pace—some jogging included if you're up for it! He's unfazed by the chaos of the world around him (cyclists, construction, strollers—bring it on) and would happily greet every person and pup he encounters. Back home, he's your kitchen companion who loves watching you cook without counter surfing or being a nuisance, your work-from-home buddy who won't interrupt your conference calls, and your most enthusiastic car ride passenger who respectfully enjoys the view from the back seat. Whether you're hitting a food truck where he'll charm the baristas or running errands, Alfie is thrilled to be along for the ride.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">He's got the basics down—sit, stay, wait, come, lay down—and his food motivation makes training a breeze. He's housetrained, crate-trained, and non-destructive when left alone. Yes, he's still mastering polite greetings (his excitement sometimes means jumping and enthusiastic kisses), but with high-value treats and consistency, he's making progress. Once the initial excitement fades, he's content to chew his toy while you visit with friends. He's dog-social from his shelter playgroup days and could live with another well-matched pup. With medium-high energy that's easily satisfied by two daily walks and enrichment toys, he balances adventure with serious nap skills.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Alfie is loyal, loving, and ready to give his whole heart to a single adult, couple, or family with kids 12 and up. This playful, affectionate, smart boy has already proven he fits seamlessly into a loving home, and now he's ready for his forever.</span></p><p><br></p><p>Email Alfie's shelter volunteer advocates at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:blueplusbusters@gmail.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(11, 87, 208);\">blueplusbusters@gmail.com</a>&nbsp;to meet him and start the process to foster or adopt!</p>",

    "description_html": "<p>Get to know Xena......... a loving brindle babe!</p><p>Xena is very smart and quick learner with the help of treats. She knows sit, shake, down, and kisses. Treats and food are big motivators and help to distract her when necessary. She is low to medium energy and rarely barks.</p><p>Xena casually strolls on a leash, but does get excited when she sees squirrels and lizards. She doesn't seem bothered by passing people or other dogs at a distance. She understands \"Let's go and This Way.\" Expect to see some zoomies in a backyard. She likes to chase soccer balls. She is also happy to sit outside with her human and people-watch.</p><p>Spending time with Xena inside - She is housetrained. She will self-entertain with toys of all kinds, not a picky girl. Give her a smoked beef bone with marrow, and she is the happiest dog. Loves, loves, loves belly rubs!!! She is at ease when being groomed (bath, nails, and ears).</p><p>Xena loves car rides and is an excellent passenger. She does not jump over seats in an SUV. She will alternate looking out the window and lying down.</p><p>Xena is a great catch! Check her out!</p><p>interested in Xena? Reach out to blueplusbusters@gmail.com for more info!</p>",

On the labrador retriever color spectrum, one might say she lands somewhere between \"lightly toasted\" and \"golden.\" She has the most adorable ears (one that sticks up and the other that flops over) and the cutest docked tail. She has shared foster homes with dogs of all sizes and energy levels. She is a fantastic dog friend because she knows how to match the energy and respect the boundaries of anyone she plays with. Ellie is house-trained, walks well on leash, and is relatively quiet (not a barker from what her foster parents can&nbsp;tell). She is non-destructive when left alone in the home, and sleeps well throughout the night. When out and about she has met babies, toddlers, teens, and seniors, and has done well with everyone. Her favorite things include walks, napping, car rides, playing, and belly rubs! If you decide to stop petting her, be prepared for her to ask for \"more pets, please!\" Ellie is not a fan of rabbits, cats, confining spaces, or loud sudden&nbsp;noises.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">Because not a whole lot is known about her past, Ellie can still be shy in new situations and around people she doesn't know. In these situations, usually a high-value treat and a little patience goes a long way to winning her over. Ellie would thrive in a home where she can demand all the belly rubs her heart desires, a doggy (or human) friend, and a cozy place to curl up. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">Click \"Get Started\" to connect with this beautiful pup in person!</span></p>",

Happy to chill by your side while you work or watch TV? Full of personality and gets along with other dogs? Then Mr. Franco might just be your unicorn! Franco is a big-hearted goofball who doesn't quite realize his own size. He's the perfect mix of cuddly and calm, with bursts of excited energy when it's time to play, especially with people, pups, or when there's food involved. Franco was recently in foster care, where he worked hard on his recall, patience, and manners. Like many tall boys, he's been known to counter-surf, but his foster mom assures us: \"We're working on it!\" Hand him a toy or a bone, and Franco's in heaven. 🏡 Ideal Home: Franco will thrive in a home that can offer him a balance of activity and downtime-think daily walks or dog park play, followed by some solid couch cuddles. Due to his size and puppy energy, we recommend a home without cats and without very young children, unless they're experienced with dogs.</p>",

Inside, he is calm and surrounds himself with as many squeak toys as possible. Though a young boy, he spends most of the day chilled with afternoons reserved for a long siesta. No problems with deer just outside the fence but the occasional squirrel will grab his attention. Though Buddy spends most of the day inside given the high outdoor temps, in the evening and early morning he enjoys being outside watching the world pass. The highlight of the day is his walk. His lease etiquette is being worked on but drastically improved over a short period of time (about 70% there). Buddy understands and obeys basic commands (stay, sit, laydown, off). If he does become excited inside, a simple command to laydown works every time. He is very respectful of the two other dogs living in the house even the little one who often try's to dominate. Too, it's amazing how little he sheds, especially compared to the other two we have but this could change throughout the year. Overall a very obedient calm boy who would love to have someone to play or spend time outside.</p>",

He is crate &amp; potty trained, and does very well just sitting on the porch or while we watch tv! He's very well behaved, knows \"sit\", \"down\", \"stay\", &amp; \"place\" (his crate &amp; bed). He loves tug of war, hide &amp; seek, and long morning &amp; evening walks. Still a young pup, he needs long walks &amp; play time to tire out his mind &amp; body - we've been walking around 3-4 miles a day! Although he does get very excited on walks &amp; pulls a bit to sniff all the smells, &amp; play with all the dogs (usually he can walk past with some peaked interest, but sometimes he does get real excited and itches to play with a very light whine and jump - were working on his focus &amp; distractions with treats + positive reinforcement when he looks up at us or checks in) with some consistent training &amp; socialization I'm certain he'd keep his attention at bay in no time! Despite his happy go lucky spirit, Disco also knows how to chill at home. He's easy to get in his crate, will sleep next to you for hours during a mellow day, and overall just loves laying down close to people. He's just about 50lbs and shouldn't grow much more, so he's perfect to take in the car (his car manners are perfect) and on adventures! Disco would be a wonderful fit for an active home willing to dedicate some time towards cuddles, tug-of-war, + a little bit of discipline &amp; consistency!</p>",

He is dog-friendly and playful when not in tight leash situations.</p><p>Bambino would shine in a house, townhome, or non–high-rise apartment - ideally somewhere without constant close-quarters dog traffic.

He regularly wins the ladies over. </p><p><br></p><p>Bear is an absolute gentleman in the home. He is<strong> </strong>potty trained and crate trained,<strong> </strong>though he would much prefer to be your \"bed hog\" if you’ll allow it! He actually jumps into the bathtub by himself and sits patiently for nail trims. He loves car rides and is ready for any road trip.</p><p><br></p><p>Bear is incredibly smart and highly food-motivated, which has made training a breeze. He already boasts an impressive resume of commands like: sit, stay, touch, leave it, come, shake, pound it!, lay down, and soon to be much more! He is amazing on a leash.</p><p><br></p><p>Because of his rough start, Bear can fearful of new people. He needs a slow introduction to strangers; while he will bravely take treats and follow commands from new friends, he prefers not to be petted until he knows he can trust you. Once you are in his \"inner circle,\" he is a velcro dog who would follow you to the end of the earth.</p><p><br></p><p>Bear’s Ideal Forever Home:</p><ul><li><strong>Presence:</strong> Someone who is home more often than not to give him the reassurance he craves. He'd love to live with another dog(s) to continue to help build his confidence.</li><li><strong>Patience:</strong> A family willing to advocate for his space during introductions until he feels comfortable.</li><li><strong>Love:</strong> Plenty of couch space for snuggles and pets.</li><li><strong>Note on Cats &amp; Kids:</strong> Bear is looking for a <strong>no-cat (ideally)</strong> household (though he lives with them at his Foster who can provide further info) and a home <strong>without young children</strong>, as he prefers a calm, predictable people environment while he’s learning that not everyone is out to get him.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Bear survived the streets, and now he’s ready to survive a long nap on a soft bed next to his favorite person(s). Is that person you?</p><p><br></p><p>Follow Bear’s journey and get to know him better on Instagram: @adopt_bestboybear. You can also check out his brother Teddy who is up for adoption too!</p>",

The moment he steps outside, he happily nudges his head between your legs for pets and affection. He starts his walks with some excitement (he’s just so thrilled to be out!), but quickly settles into a loose-leash stroll and checks in often. Volunteers describe him as an easy, loving companion who’s just happy to be by your side.</p><p><br></p><p>Wrigley does well with most dogs who share his soft, gentle play style. He also thrives in a home setting, where he shows off his goofy, playful side. Though he isn’t especially treat-motivated, his eagerness to connect with people makes him a joy to work with. He does have a high prey drive, so he’ll need supervision when wildlife is around and may be best suited to a home without cats or other small animals.</p>",

Snuffle mats are a favorite, and he clearly enjoys enrichment activities.

He is non-destructive!</p><p><br></p><p>The play yard is where Radar truly shines. He comes out of his shell and loves chasing balls and toys. He is fantastic at fetch, where he will bring the ball back, drop it at your feet, and back up a few steps giving you space to pick up the ball and throw it again! He also enjoys running around and sniffing, fully taking in the environment with confidence and curiosity.</p><p><br></p><p>Come meet Radar today!</p>",

Despite his enthusiasm, Ink is surprisingly easy to handle — volunteers found him simple to harness and eager to head out for fun. Once in the play yard, Ink is in his element: zooming around, chasing toys, and soaking up every moment. Outside the play yard, Ink is also a great jogging buddy in the making and happily kept pace on a short jog with one of his volunteer friends. He knows sit, likes treats, and is a smart boy who will be easy to train and be up for any adventure with his new people!</p>",

She recently attended several busy adoption events full of new people, dogs, sights and sounds and Goldie was a perfect little lady and behaved beautifully. She was great with all the kids who stopped to pet her as well. She is about 99% potty trained and she's a natural at walking on a loose leash! She adores fetch and tug-of-war. She loves to play with other dogs and wears out her two big canine foster brothers running around the yard. She has been around a cat and wanted to play with it. But she's still a puppy and can adapt to living with cats. This sweet little lady would make a stellar family dog and a great active buddy for anyone looking for a pup that is equal parts energetic adventurer and snugglebug!&nbsp;Could she be your dreamgirl???</p>",

    "description_html": "<p>Pickles is mellow for a floppy puppy. He is curious and intelligent, knowing sit and other commands. He looks at you in the eyes and is ready to follow you anywhere, especially if cheese is involved. He has been unlucky in that he's been back in quarantine for a cold for a while, then the pneumovirus outbreak happened. If this sweet boy saw more people, he'd be snatched up.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>RE In Foster</strong>: If you're looking for SNUGGLES, ADVENTURE, and a dog with CHARACTER, Pickles is the perfect fur baby for you! He's very intelligent for a puppy, already knowing the basic commands (sit + shake - we're working on lay down) and fairly good at walking on a leash in public (he responds to heel!). He's a large puppy with the mindset of a small lap dog, he LOVES a good cuddle sesh and sleeping in, and he always surprises us with the variety of funny ways he likes to snooze! He goes crazy for his stuffed animals, BALLS, and tug of war toys. Besides being playful, he's extremely food motivated and unfortunately a very messy drinker - we're trying to teach him to wipe his mouth but it's not going well. Pickles grows to be pretty protective of the people he loves, but he's open minded to meeting new people slowly. We're still working a bit on his teething, but I'm sure with training and love from his forever family it's a habit he'll grow out of quickly! Pickles is a SWEETHEART and is so excited to be with his forever family and show off his goofy, clumsy, and loving personality! (Jan 29, 2026)</p>",

Her ears are luxurious, her tail is super wags. I found her on the streets a couple months ago, her history is unknown - she's on a grand adventure and looking for her forever people. Her top priorities are snuggles and pillow princess naps, and activities such as supervising squirrels and sticks, and rumpus time with toys or dog friends. Flora loves doing whatever you're doing. She's well-behaved and engaged on walks, plays well with my dog, and learns games and tricks easily. If left to her own devices, she'll make a nest of any available pillows and chill. She's untested with children, but she's a mama, very gentle and sweet with everyone. Flora is housetrained, solid on basic commands, treat motivated and eager to please. She's working on leash reactivity, and responding well to redirection. Flora is so chill, when you give her a loving home she'll be happy with the daily activities of your household. Flora is spayed and chipped, up to date on vaccinations, and takes Symparica Trio monthly. She's in great shape, no known conditions.</span></p>",

    "description_html": "<p>Hi, my name is Holly, or Holly Doll as my mom likes to call me. I guess she always tells me that I am such a doll…whatever that means. I want to start off by saying that I am really, really laid back. I think they call me a lap dog, which I laugh at, because I really am too big for your lap, but I enjoy snuggling up all close to you and laying in your lap and giving you tons of affection.&nbsp;I do love playing with my big Boxer sister, but I look forward to my downtime where I can stretch my body out and just relax. I will get along with any dog really, as I am mild mannered and incredibly respectful of their space, food, toys and treats.</p><p>I do love a good squeaky toy every now and then, too. I enjoy my walks and I am very, very good on a leash. I get so excited when I see people or other dogs when I am out, but I cannot help it, I enjoy the attention and want to play!! &nbsp;I am working on controlling my excitement though – which is no fun. I appear to be good with kids, although I don’t currently live with any, but my mom can tell how happy I get when we see kids out and about. I wag my tail really fast and tap my feet and try to pull her near them. I don’t know if I am good with cats either. I do not currently live with any and we haven’t come across any on my walks. I can keep you posted though. </p><p>I am crate, leash, house and potty trained. I learn very quickly and I love the one-on-one time I get with my mom when she is teaching me. &nbsp;I am not a big barker, although my Boxer sister sometimes tries to get me to join in with her, but I can resist. I like riding in cars and will jump right in to go anywhere.</p><p>Overall, I am a wonderful pup. I can have little bursts of puppy energy, but for most of the day, I am laid back. I am super friendly and sweet. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

    "description_html": "<p>Meet Chip! Chip is a curious yet gentle bunny who enjoys exploring and spending time around people on his own terms. He likes to approach for attention and investigation, then retreat to his pen when he's ready to relax. Chip communicates clearly when he needs space, so he'd do best with someone who understands and respects bunny boundaries. He loves head and back rubs, but prefers not to have his feet or belly touched and does not enjoy being picked up. Carrots are his favorite treat, while bananas are a definite no! Chip can be sensitive to loud noises, so a calm home without very young children or dogs would suit him best. With the right introduction, he may also be a good candidate for bonding with another rabbit. Overall, Chip is a sweet, thoughtful bunny who will thrive in a patient, loving home that lets him blossom at his own pace. 🐰💛</p>",

She's still likely to hiss if approached too quickly and be tightened up as hard as a rock when you touch her, but with some dedication I have gotten her to start relaxing during pets and even put her chin up and press into some neck and chin scritches. Definitely can't pick her up with your hands, but placing a blanket or towel over her makes her limp enough to handle and transport her. I believe she can be domesticated and put into a good home, but it will take continued work. Named Persephone because I got two kittens from her the year before these four kittens, so she was like Persephone coming back from the underworld every year bringing me new pretty babies. She has now been spayed to end that cycle!</p>",

She’s a total cuddle bug who loves leaning on you, touching you, and sleeping right on top of you like a weighted blanket. She has a goofy, funny personality and is incredibly sweet with people.</p><p>She has low-to-medium energy and is happy with a mix of playtime (fetch, tug, chew toys) and lots of naps. She can do well in an apartment as long as she gets daily walks.</p><p>Gemma is very strong and currently a big puller on leash, especially when she sees other dogs, so continued leash training will be important. That said, she has shown no aggression on walks and rarely barks. She takes treats gently and is food-motivated, which should make training easier.</p><p>At home, Gemma is a dream. She’s fully potty trained with no accidents, sleeps through the night, and is not destructive. She currently lives with two adults and has done great. Her compatibility with other dogs, cats, and kids is still being evaluated; due to her size and excitement level, she’d do best with children 10+. Slow, thoughtful introductions to other dogs are recommended.</p><p>If you’re looking for a cuddly, loyal companion with a big heart and a great sense of humor, Gemma might be your perfect match.</p><p>See more of her at @keep.austin.furry 💛</p>",

This calm &amp; stoic boy is shy at first, but once you’ve gained his trust, you become the center of his world and he shows you his goofy side. Milo was surrendered to the shelter because his family had to leave the country, but he is flourishing in a foster home now and is ready to find his forever people!&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Milo is a mellow, easy pup. He is perfectly housetrained and naps most of the day with the occasional adorable waggly request for some pets. Milo is easy on walks - he doesn't pull on the leash and, while he's curious about things we pass (squirrels, cats, people, other dogs), he shows friendly interest then moves on. He is a quiet boy (very little barking) and takes treats gently from your hand like a dainty prince. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Milo loves sniffs and exploring outside; he would do great in a house with a secure yard or an apartment where he gets lots of good walks. Milo could fit in with most any lifestyle - he’s laid back so doesn’t need a ton of exercise/stimulation, but could also be a great running buddy. Milo would be the perfect family dog - he lived with both a child and a cat before the shelter and is currently living with another dog in his foster home. He would especially love to have a canine friend in his forever home who can keep him company and help him build confidence!</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">And did we mention his ears?! They are magical and definitely deserve some kind of award.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Click “Get Started” on the right to be connected to Milo’s foster and meet this gentle, soulful boy!</span></p>",

She's as sweet as they come and loves affections. She made fast friends with the senior male dog too. She likes to play when he'll oblige, and is respectful when he doesn't. She's the perfect fur friend for home. </p><p><br></p><p>One thing on Cheyenne's wish list - she tries hard to run but can't get past a slow trot - she wants to run like the wind, but her left front leg is dragging along and holding her back. It's not been functioning for what appears to be a very long time. She has no pain and also no neurological response from the elbow down so it will be removed on Feb 19th under our medical sponsorship. After her recovery we can't wait to see her gain momentum and then finally run in the wind, never to be held back again by a leg dragging alongside her.

Part of a family for 4 years, her life took a turn that left her feeling lost and alone. Since then she's found places to go, but not her happy, stable place to stay in life,,, nothing has been forever. Most recently she was found alone on IH-130. The Animal Protection Officer who picked her up described her as a \"</span>Very sweet girl, just takes a lot of time to warm up\". <span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(244, 245, 246);\">Marcela knows all about abandonment, yet simple kindness, and a sense of calm, and acceptance, is the door to her heart. It doesn't take long to unlock the warmth and affections. She's a great house mate and especially cherishes quiet moments of connection with her people, interlaced with some playful moments and toys here and there. Do you have a calm relaxed home for Marcela to feel secure and loved in that you might like to share with her? We invite you to visit her soon or reach out to her advocates at caring@classiccanines.org.</span></p>",

She readily goes in her crate and settles.</p><p><br></p><p>We have a very old dog and she is respectful of him.

She is 100% a cuddle dog and will proudly volunteer as your little spoon any chance she gets. If you’re looking for a loyal companion who loves to cuddle on the couch- She’s your girl.</p><p><br></p><p>She’s also a dream in the home:</p><ul><li>✅ Fully crate trained — sleeps in her crate overnight for up to 12 hours and goes in willingly during the day</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>✅ Potty trained — no issues with potty training. She learned to do her business outside by day 2. I had her for 3 weeks and we had no issues with accidents. She typically poops once a day in the morning and does her business IMMEDIATELY when you let her outside. No hemming and hawing there.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>🍖 Very food motivated, which makes her eager to learn and train. Will eat absolutely anything you give her and inhales her food, we used a slow feeder.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Carmelita is working on her leash manners and she’s making quick progress! a great sign of her potential with continued guidance and consistency. In our 3 weeks together she progressed very quickly with leash training, with treats and attention distraction she doesn’t bark or have reactivity.</p><p><br></p><p>She has the cutest little prance / trot that she does when excited and these adorable low</p><p>vocals at meal time (see video).</p><p><br></p><p>She is not vocal during the day unless she sees people outside the windows. If she can’t see outside, she’s quite as a mouse.</p><p><br></p><p>She doesn’t show any separation anxiety and goes in her crate no problem during the day when you’re leaving. She doesn’t bark in the crate and is a real angel with crate time. Goes right in at bedtime.</p><p><br></p><p>I did not have other pets or kids in the home with Carmelita but she sees kids on a walks and greets them and wiggles her butt. She loves kids, I believe she came from a home with kids because she always wanted to greet and interact with children.</p><p><br></p><p>I also think she may speak Spanish, lol. She is very attracted to Spanish speaking. I bet she knows commands in Spanish (I do not speak Spanish unfortunately).</p><p><br></p><p>I did not get to test her with other dogs but she is playful and curious by nature and not aggressive.</p><p>She is obsessed with sniffing and spends half her walk sniffing. She also loves water! (See video).</p><p><br></p><p>She knows commands like sit and wait (see video). She will patiently wait in her crate while you feed her meals until you “release” her with an “okay”.</p><p><br></p><p>I would love to answer any questions you may have about Carmelita. Feel free to email me at cori@alitelaser.com.</p><p><br></p><p>Carmelita is ready to find her forever home — and her forever couch. 🐾💖</p>",

She loves her occasional zoomies, grass rolls, back scratches, and 20 minutes later, you might find her curled up for a nap. See her short video <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DUFDnx0jYnX/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>!</p><p><br></p><p>Dolce does not seem bothered by small animals that make their home nearby, including squirrels, birds, and even stray cats. We think she might enjoy having a dog friend. If you have a resident dog at home, you can set up a doggie meet with her.</p><p><br></p><p><u>From her foster parents</u>: Dolce is a dream doggo that seems almost too good to be true. Being the very trusting and loving bundle of joy that she is, Dolce is a perfect embodiment of her name and warmed up to us with belly rubs just within our first few minutes of meeting her. She is extremely affectionate and is almost guaranteed to snuggle right next to you and politely request scratches if you sit down at her level.</p><p><br></p><p>Dolce is extremely well-trained (house-, potty-, crate-, leash-trained!) and responds very well to commands like 'sit', 'leave it', 'come here', and 'out'. She also has not had a single accident since joining our home. She appears to be familiar with apartment environments and is confident with stairs and elevators. Dolce also has not reacted to any person, animal, or object (including a guy biking by with a broom!) and responds very well to redirections (verbal commands or tugging the leash). This also means she is an absolute dream on the leash (no pulling at all). Dolce is a classic gentle giant - picking up treats carefully from our hands and nudging her head into our hands for more pets. She is also crate-trained, and demonstrated this on her first night by heading straight to her crate the moment we brought her into our home and consistently sleeping/napping in there.</p><p><br></p><p>Dolce is a little overweight as of early Jan 2026, but we are working on lots of exercise and a balanced diet to get her back to her healthy self (and relieve some pressure from those joints!). She is already showing promising signs - she aced long walks and short runs with amazing energy, and has already gotten used to being hand-fed a healthy amount of food throughout the day.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are interested in sweet Dolce, please reach out for a meet and greet! We know Dolce would be 10000% thrilled to see and get to know you, and you will get to see her almost fly away with her tail! :)</p><p><br></p><p>More short videos of Dolce that showcase her personality:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/aqiSYbPBT_Y\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dolce showing off her sitting ability!</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/jxmgutsduvg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dolce making conversation!</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/YBK0QrwvFm0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dolce CANNOT wait to go on a walk! (and she's a dream on the leash!)</a></p>",

    "description_html": "<p><strong>Meet Indy – Your Future Adventure Buddy &amp; Professional Cuddle Companion! 🐾</strong></p><p>Indy is a smart, playful girl with a big heart and an even bigger love for her people. She truly believes everyone she meets is her new best friend — and she’s not wrong. 💛</p><p><br></p><p>This bright girl is always ready to run and wrestle with her dog friends! She was in a foster home with a 9-year-old Mini Aussie and a 2-year-old Lab and loved every minute of playtime. Indy shows zero aggression and would absolutely thrive in a home with another young, playful dog to help burn off her energy.</p><p><br></p><p>When the fun winds down, Indy transforms into the ultimate cuddle bug. She loves to curl up behind you while you nap and is happiest when she’s close to her person. If left alone, she may cry a little — she just really loves company! With her people, though, she’s calm, quiet, and affectionate.</p><p><br></p><p>Indy is incredibly smart and picks up on new things quickly. She enjoys puzzle toys, Kongs, durable chew toys, and bones — especially the indestructible kind! Mealtime is serious business for Indy; she eats dry food and <em>inhaled</em> it, so a slow feeder works great to help her pace herself.</p><p><br></p><p>She’s still working on her house training and will need consistency and patience as she continues learning. Frequent potty breaks (about every 30 minutes when someone is home) have helped her succeed, but she may have accidents if left alone too long. Indy is also not a fan of crates and has proven she’s quite the escape artist, so a home prepared to work on positive crate training — or explore alternative management solutions — will be important.</p><p><br></p><p>On leash, Indy doesn’t pull but is easily distracted by the exciting world around her. With her quick mind and eagerness to learn, she has great potential to become a wonderful walking partner.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Indy’s Ideal Home:</strong></p><ul><li>Another young, playful dog</li><li>Active adults who can provide structure and training</li><li>Someone home often (she loves companionship!)</li><li>Plenty of durable toys and enrichment</li></ul><p><br></p><p>If you’re looking for a playful best friend who will keep you laughing, learning, and snuggling, Indy might just be your girl. 🐶💕</p>",

She loves pets and attention, and will likely want to be right by her favorite person's side for snuggles.</p>",
