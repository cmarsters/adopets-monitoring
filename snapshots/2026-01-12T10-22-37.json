    "description_html": "<p>Who loves movie night?! Jade does and she's looking for a couch potato buddy. She's also the hostess with the mostest - she loves having people over and is great at making sure everyone feels welcome! Her foster friends say, \"Jade is house trained and low key in the house. She is not destructive &amp; can be left alone, and she enjoys cuddling but is not super pushy. This girl loves to nap and loves to eat! AKA she is super easy to please. She also sleeps through the night like a gem and has to be woken up by her humans for breakfast. Jade lived with a toddler for 2 weeks and was incredibly gentle. Jade loves to sunbathe and chill in the backyard. She gets excited to zoom around when given the opportunity, but then reverts back to her calm, cuddly self in the house. Jade's only \"difficult\" trait, which I assume is the reason she has yet to be adopted, is that she does need to be in an only pet home. However, with a family with a yard and no other pets, she would be the easiest dog ever and best companion!\"</p>",

She will greet you every morning with full body wiggles and a smile! (Yes, an actual smile!)\r\n\r\nCandy Land knows how to sit and how to go get in her spot, whether that's her bed or her spot on the couch. She has been taught food manners; she will sit and wait until you say yes before eating her meal. She is very food motivated, which is great for training and nail trimming, but don't leave food trash out because she'll happily vacuum up every last morsel! She gently accepts treats and doesn't beg while you finish a meal; a true lady.\r\n\r\nShe would be a great family dog as she does well around older kids. She is dog selective, but has lived with other dogs well matched. She loves car rides and will sit well in the front or the back seat. She even enjoys the window down a little bit!\r\n\r\nFun facts about Candy Land are she does well around farm animals, can bounce on a trampoline, and only barks at the scary Amazon delivery man!\r\n\r\nCandy Land was in the shelter for a long period of time, but has really opened up in foster care to show what a sweet and loving girl she is. Please reach out if you're ready to give this sweet girl the forever home she's looking for!",

    "description_html": "Geedorah (GeeGee for short) has the most striking eyes. Combine those eyes with fun merle spots on her head and she's one beautiful pup!\r\n\r\nThis sweet gal starts out a little shy then really starts to shine once she gets to know you, accepting gentle pets and nicely taking treats. GeeGee loves other dogs-she immediately became fast friends with her foster brother, running around the backyard and playing. She likes but is also respectful of her two elderly, smaller foster sisters when they don't want to play. She was a little interested in her foster guinea pig siblings at first, but once they were shown to her up close, she lost interest. So no problem for her if there are small animals in the house.\r\n\r\nMiss GeeGee is a smart cookie. She learned the dog door in two days from watching her siblings. She's also crate trained and is comfortable in her crate overnight or during the day when her people are at work.\r\n\r\nIf you like walks, this girl can be your best buddy! She easily keeps up with her foster mom for 2-3 miles. GeeGee is also happy to chill with her family. She's really starting to enjoy and seek out couch cuddles both with her people and her foster siblings. The middle of a cuddle puddle is now one of her favorite spots! Geedorah can also entertain herself with toys (stuffies and ropes) and chew treats like benebones. Since she's four years old, she's past the crazy puppy energy but still has many years to love her forever family.\r\n\r\nAt a compact 35 pounds, Geedorah is the perfect size for any household. Come meet this amazing girl and fall in love with your new best friend!\r\n\r\nCheck out Geedorah's Instagram: @adopt_GeeGee_dog",

My foster parents gave me that name since I spent my life being so powerless, now it is my time to learn what it's like to have power. I had a very rough first half of life, and am ready to be loved. I finished all of my medical treatment and am a very healthy boy. I am starting to realize the world isn't so scary. I am still a bit nervous, but love being pet and chilling out with a chew stick. I like to stay glued to someone's leg when I am on the leash and am great about going to the bathroom outside. My foster cat and dog brothers are both spooky to me even when they stand still so I ignore them. My foster rabbit brother isn't as scary to me though. I am gaining a love for life and am looking for my forever human or humans to spend the rest of my life with. I will be your sweetest and most loyal family member!</p>",

He's living in a foster home where he's proven to be very housetrained, for a full work day. He enjoys the security of his crate sometimes  and isn't anxious at all to be left alone and simply sleeps the time away. He does enjoy sleeping by his person if allowed. He likes baths and has learned a love of some toys and short zoomie sessions in the yard. He's been a joy for his foster to watch unfold now that he doesn't have to figure out the basics of life for himself. Reach out to learn more. He's had some light experience around dogs including a smaller dog, and has not yet met cats. A meet and greet with a resident dog can be scheduled at the shelter.

Draco is looking for a family who will spend time with him, building his confidence and teaching him about the world. He's a very sweet boy that so wants to be with his people.</p><p>We think Draco would make a great around town pup, that you could take anywhere that's pet friendly. He loves to play in water! Draco may seem like a lot of energy in his kennel, but that's only because he wants to be out and with you. It's stressful living in a loud kennel. He's a sensitive soul that would make a special companion to any household. He crates himself for meals to wait on his food. And Draco knows Sit, Bed, Touch, and can sometimes Stay.</p><p>So, if you're looking for a friend till the end, then Draco is your boy!</p><p>If you have any questions, please reach out to orangedotcrew@gmail.com to kickstart this heartwarming journey.

Meet&nbsp;<strong>Sunshine,&nbsp;</strong>a six-year-old cattle dog/border collie mix who is 40% brilliance, 40% sass, and 20% “ma’am, this is a Wendy’s.”</p><p>At the shelter, Sunshine expresses her feelings through&nbsp;<em>Bark</em>, the ancient language of the Extremely Stressed. She performs this opera for anyone within a three-block radius. But it’s only because the shelter is a stressful place to be, and Sunshine knows she doesn’t belong here. She knows she is meant to live a life of leisure with humans who love her and keep her well stocked with treats and toys, and she will continue her protest of living here through barking loudly to ask to speak to the manager.&nbsp;</p><p>Once she’s out of the shelter? She transforms. Suddenly she’s a polite, leash-walking, car-riding, house-trained queen (who only barks sometimes when she spots other dogs or animals, but in fairness to Sunshine, why are there ducks and geese at the park??)&nbsp;</p><p>Sunshine is not here for your nonsense. She demands an adopter who appreciates a woman with boundaries, personality, a strong sense of fashion, and just a hint of chaos. She is affectionate, loyal, occasionally dramatic, and fully prepared to narrate the neighborhood gossip from your front window. She expects daily cuddle sessions, the last bite of whatever you’re eating, and for the photos saved on your phone to exclusively document her beauty.&nbsp;</p><p>Sunshine doesn’t want to be perfect; she wants to be&nbsp;<strong>iconic</strong>. And she is.</p><p>If you’re ready to embrace a dog who sparkles, snuggles, and sasses her way into your heart, head to Austin Animal Services&nbsp;to meet Sunshine. She’s waiting to charm you… loudly at first, and then forever.&nbsp;</p><p>Email her agents at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:blueplusbusters@gmail.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(66, 133, 244);\">blueplusbusters@gmail.com</a>&nbsp;to bring some Sunshine into your life.&nbsp;</p>",

In his current foster home, he free-roams like the responsible adult he is. No chewed furniture, no chaos—just good boy vibes. He’s even been left alone for long stretches and handled it like a champ.</p><p>Benji lives with a male dog and LOVES having a play buddy. When his dog friend isn’t in the mood, Benji has no problem entertaining himself with toys, bones, and solo playtime. When meeting new dogs, he sometimes comes in a little… enthusiastic. Think “Hi!Hi!Hi!Let’sBeBestFriends!” right out of the gate. With proper introductions, he’s thrilled to make doggy friends.</p><p>Despite his playful energy, Benji takes his beauty rest very seriously and fits naps into his daily schedule like a true professional. He is a <strong>HUGE cuddle bug</strong> and firmly believes couches and beds exist <em>specifically</em> for snuggling. On work-from-home days, he’ll either quietly entertain himself or snooze right next to your desk as your emotional support coworker.</p><p>Benji is also a total people-lover. Friends coming over? Best day ever. Male, female, doesn’t matter—Benji is excited to say hello and will quickly wiggle his way into snuggle position on the couch.</p><p><br></p><p>If you’re looking for a dog who’s playful, affectionate, low-drama at home, and always down to cuddle, Benji is ready to move in and steal your heart (and probably your spot on the couch). 🐾💙</p>",

She's earned a reputation as a lap dog.</p><p><br></p><p>Bunny has a condition that makes her wobbly and unsteady on her feet, but she is aided by standard traction helpers like rugs, mats and being on flat surfaces when outdoors. Her Help Em Up harness also makes things a whole lot easier to guide her when needed. Bunny will do best in a single story arrangement as an only animal in her home.</p><p><br></p><p>Bunny's care includes occasional skin and eye management, and keeping her muscles in good tone. Her advocates at ClassicCaninesATX have been providing her care at an outside clinic and will help with supplies and some future veterinary care funding for an adopter.</p><p><br></p><p>Are you ready to make a difference in the life of a lady that has come this far already to prepare to meet you? Are you the person who will welcome her to unconditional forever love? Put her on your short list - and reach out on her link to talk with her foster provider or contact caring@classiccanines.org with questions about adoption support.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Watch her Pet of the Week highlight </span><a href=\"https://www.fox7austin.com/video/1700133\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">!</span></p><p><br></p><p>See portions of Bunny's journey over the past few months <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMPDgontVUG/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTCs-ATRLxIaSJnJwOudqiIRsF7NxgSr-Mq7Ivr9k_nUl3kf6MaTvnXKMsqSpdW6WmPvD8nr7wdEwsd/pub?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">here</a></p>",

He’s a soft, gentle player with other dogs and loves making new human friends—especially if belly rubs are on the table!</p><p>This charming boy recently had a field trip to a foster home and absolutely nailed it. He was completely house-trained (not a single accident!), respectful indoors, and settled in beautifully. His one hilarious misstep? He couldn’t resist hopping on the counter to check out a forgotten bag of cheese—but hey, can you blame him? One quick “off” and he was back to being the perfect guest. No repeats, just good boy energy from then on.</p><p>He explored the home calmly, played with <em>every</em> squeaky toy, and then curled up on the couch for a cozy nap. When a familiar friend came to visit, Chicharrón greeted her with happy wiggles and calm excitement—clearly a dog who knows how to balance joy and manners.</p><p>He also did great in the car, hopping right in, entertaining himself with toys in the backseat, and taking in the world through the window with quiet curiosity.</p><p>Chicharrón is the total package: house-savvy, leash-lovin’, toy-obsessed, and full of affection. If you’re looking for a loyal companion who’s equal parts playful and chill, this very good boy is ready to be your new best friend.</p><p><strong>Adopt Chicharrón and bring home a dog who’s already mastered the art of being wonderful.</strong> 🐶💫</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); background-color: rgb(247, 247, 252);\">If you have any questions, please reach out to&nbsp;</span><a href=\"mailto:orangedotcrew@gmail.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">orangedotcrew@gmail.com</a><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); background-color: rgb(247, 247, 252);\">&nbsp;to kickstart this heartwarming journey.

He's got all the great qualities - house-trained, non-destructive when left alone, loves people, enjoys playing with other dogs, playful, good with kids, and oh-so-sweet. \"Tender little muffin man\" is how one of his volunteer besties describes him.</p><p>To learn more about sweet York, press the \"Get Started\" button!</p>",

    "description_html": "Would you like to adopt a very special cat? Roo is definitely special, and worth a little extra effort. She has a neurological condition that affects her balance and coordination (she wobbles when she walks). We believe that Roo was born with this condition, and it will probably not worsen or improve with time. She requires a large litterbox so that she doesn't miss (her foster dad customized one, and it goes with her when she's adopted). \r\n\r\nRoo is an extremely happy, affectionate cat. She is playful (her fave is a wand toy), and she loves nothing more than to be in a lap and snuggle. She walks around well on tile floors, but she does best on carpeting. She can't jump or climb, so a low window that she can look out would be ideal.\r\n\r\nI am a DHC, and I have my own webpage: http://www.desperatehousecats.info/flyers/Roo7099.pdf\r\n\r\nThe adoption fee is waived for Roo and all Desperate Housecats!\r\n",

Treats and food are big motivators and help to distract her when necessary. She is low to medium energy. She does not bark a lot outside the shelter.</p><p><br></p><p>Spending time with Xena outside - She casually strolls on a leash but does get excited when she sees squirrels and lizards. She doesn't seem bothered passing people or other dogs at a distance. She understands \"Let's go and This Way\" if she gets fixated on things. Expect to see some zoomies in a backyard. She likes to chase soccer balls. She is also happy to sit outside with her human and people watch.</p><p><br></p><p>Spending time with Xena inside - She is house trained. She will self-entertain with toys of all kinds, not a picky girl. Give her a smoked beef bone with marrow and she is the happiest dog. Loves, loves, loves belly rubs!!! She is at ease when grooming (bath, nails, and ears).</p><p><br></p><p>Xena in the car - She loves car rides and is an excellent passenger. She does not jump over seats in an SUV. She will alternate looking out the window and laying down.</p><p><br></p><p>Xena is a great catch! Check her out!</p>",

    "description_html": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">Sweet, silly, and affectionate, Ellie is the most beautiful golden girl looking for a soft place to land and a family to call her own. On the labrador retriever color spectrum, one might say she lands somewhere between \"lightly toasted\" and \"golden.\" She has the most adorable ears (one that sticks up and the other that flops over) and the cutest docked tail. She is currently housed with an older, mellow dog and a younger, active dog. She is a fantastic dog friend because she knows how to match the energy and respect the boundaries of anyone she plays with. Ellie is house-trained, a loose-leash walker, quiet (not a big barker from what her foster parents can&nbsp;tell), doesn't get on furniture unless invited, is non-destructive when left alone in the home, and sleeps well throughout the night. When out and about she has met babies, toddlers, teens, and seniors, and has done well with everyone. Her favorite things include walks, napping, car rides, playing, and belly rubs! If you decide to stop petting her, be prepared for her to politely ask for \"more pets, please!\" Ellie is not a fan of rabbits, cats, closed doors in confining spaces, loud sudden&nbsp;noises, or flags flapping in the breeze.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">Because not a whole lot is known about her past, Ellie can still be shy in new situations and around people she doesn't know. In these situations, usually a high-value treat and a little patience goes a long way to winning her over. Ellie would thrive in a home where she can demand all the belly rubs her heart desires, and a cozy place to curl up. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">Click \"Get Started\" to connect with this beautiful pup in person!</span></p>",

He may prefer a calmer home with a cat savvy person to set him up for success. He's not a great fit for small children or dogs. This poor guy could use a place to decompress and get his kitty life back on track!",

On walks, he always finds something like an empty water bottle to crunch and carry for a few feet before dropping it—every time! He loves stuffed toys and will happily entertain himself for as long as you let him.</p><p>For handling, Cooper does best with close-in neighbors and a soft toy to hold while harnessing (he’s not interested in treats at that moment). He can be amped up on exit, so treat tosses help him focus moving down the kennel run. Once outside, he may pull at first due to pent-up energy, but he settles nicely when given time to sniff grass, bushes, and trees.</p><p>Cooper loves the play yard, especially with toys. Without them, his excitement can turn jumpy. Shelter life is tough for him, and his big feelings sometimes come out as mouthy excitement—having a toy helps him regulate and relax.</p>",

Happy to chill by your side while you work or watch TV? Full of personality and gets along with other dogs? Then Mr. Franco might just be your unicorn! Franco is a big-hearted goofball who doesn't quite realize his own size. He's the perfect mix of cuddly and calm, with bursts of excited energy when it's time to play, especially with people, pups, or when there's food involved. Franco was recently in foster care, where he worked hard on his recall, patience, and manners. Like many tall boys, he's been known to counter-surf, but his foster mom assures us: \"We're working on it!\" Hand him a toy or a bone, and Franco's in heaven. 🏡 Ideal Home: Franco will thrive in a home that can offer him a balance of activity and downtime-think daily walks or dog park play, followed by some solid couch cuddles. Due to his size and puppy energy, we recommend a home without cats and without very young children, unless they're experienced with dogs.</p>",

Though he likes being around his dog companions he really enjoys being around kids playing outside. Game of fetch or just about any other game is ok with Buddy. Inside, he is calm and surrounds himself with as many squeak toys as possible. Though a young boy, he spends most of the day chilled with afternoons reserved for a long siesta. No problems with deer just outside the fence but the occasional squirrel will grab his attention. Though Buddy spends most of the day inside given the high outdoor temps, in the evening and early morning he enjoys being outside watching the world pass. The highlight of the day is his walk. His lease etiquette is being worked on but drastically improved over a short period of time (about 70% there). Buddy understands and obeys basic commands (stay, sit, laydown, off). If he does become excited inside, a simple command to laydown works every time. He is very respectful of the two other dogs living in the house even the little one who often try's to dominate. Too, it's amazing how little he sheds, especially compared to the other two we have but this could change throughout the year. Overall a very obedient calm boy who would love to have someone to play or spend time outside.</p>",

    "description_html": "<p>Per Disco's previous foster: Disco is a sweet, smart &amp; lovable 1.5 year old pup who can be energetic and playful yet mellow when just hanging out. He is crate &amp; potty trained, and does very well just sitting on the porch or while we watch tv! He's very well behaved, knows \"sit\", \"down\", \"stay\", &amp; \"place\" (his crate &amp; bed). He loves tug of war, hide &amp; seek, and long morning &amp; evening walks. Still a young pup, he needs long walks &amp; play time to tire out his mind &amp; body - we've been walking around 3-4 miles a day! Although he does get very excited on walks &amp; pulls a bit to sniff all the smells, &amp; play with all the dogs (usually he can walk past with some peaked interest, but sometimes he does get real excited and itches to play with a very light whine and jump - were working on his focus &amp; distractions with treats + positive reinforcement when he looks up at us or checks in) with some consistent training &amp; socialization I'm certain he'd keep his attention at bay in no time! Despite his happy go lucky spirit, Disco also knows how to chill at home. He's easy to get in his crate, will sleep next to you for hours during a mellow day, and overall just loves laying down close to people. He's just about 50lbs and shouldn't grow much more, so he's perfect to take in the car (his car manners are perfect) and on adventures! Disco would be a wonderful fit for an active home willing to dedicate some time towards cuddles, tug-of-war, + a little bit of discipline &amp; consistency!</p>",

He is a sensitive soul who is looking for a partner to show him that the world is a safe place. Everyone that meets him comments on how chill he is and how sweet his personality is.</p><p><br></p><p>Bear is an absolute gentleman in the home. He is<strong> </strong>potty trained and crate trained,<strong> </strong>though he would much prefer to be your \"bed hog\" if you’ll allow it! He actually jumps into the bathtub by himself and sits patiently for nail trims. He loves car rides and is ready for any road trip.</p><p><br></p><p>Bear is incredibly smart and highly food-motivated, which has made training a breeze. He already boasts an impressive resume of commands like: sit, stay, touch, leave it, come, shake, pound it!, lay down, and soon to be much more! He is amazing on a leash.</p><p><br></p><p>Because of his rough start, Bear can fearful of new people.. He needs a slow introduction to strangers; while he will bravely take treats and follow commands from new friends, he prefers not to be petted until he knows he can trust you. Once you are in his \"inner circle,\" he is a velcro dog who would follow you to the end of the earth.</p><p><br></p><p>Bear’s Ideal Forever Home:</p><ul><li><strong>Presence:</strong> Someone who is home more often than not to give him the reassurance he craves. He'd love to live with another dog(s) to continue to help build his confidence.</li><li><strong>Patience:</strong> A family willing to advocate for his space during introductions.</li><li><strong>Love:</strong> Plenty of couch space for snuggles and pets.</li><li><strong>Note on Cats &amp; Kids:</strong> Bear is looking for a <strong>no-cat (ideally)</strong> household (though he lives with them at his Foster who can provide further info) and a home <strong>without young children</strong>, as he prefers a calm, predictable environment.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Bear survived the streets, and now he’s ready to survive a long nap on a soft bed next to his favorite person(s). Is that person you?</p><p><br></p><p>Follow Bear’s journey and get to know him better on Instagram: @adopt_bestboybear. You can also check out his brother Teddy who is up for adoption too!</p>",

    "description_html": "<p>Meet Radar!</p><p><br></p><p>We don't know much about Radar's past, as he was abandoned on campus one day with 4 of his siblings. Since then he's been a little shy but is starting to warm up!</p><p><br></p><p>On leash, Radar is a relaxed walker who enjoys moving at a comfortable pace, taking frequent sniff breaks to explore his surroundings. He’s perfectly content with a shorter walk and loves to “check in” with you along the way, offering plenty of adorable nose boops.</p><p><br></p><p>In a house setting Radar enjoys exploring and engaging his brain. Snuffle mats are a favorite, and he clearly enjoys enrichment activities. When it comes to toys, he’s enthusiastic but polite—if you toss one, he’ll happily run to grab it, drop it right away, then turn and wait patiently for you to pick it up and throw it again.  He is non-destructive!</p><p><br></p><p>The play yard is where Radar truly shines. He comes out of his shell and loves chasing balls and toys. He is fantastic at fetch, where he will bring the ball back, drop it at your feet, and back up a few steps giving you space to pick up the ball and throw it again! He also enjoys running around and sniffing, fully taking in the environment with confidence and curiosity.</p><p><br></p><p>Come meet Radar today!</p>",

    "description_html": "<p>Nova was surrendered due to their owner's living arrangement changing. She's Smart, loyal, sweet, and playful. She's a very good girl for baths, too! Nova's favorite things are taking walks with her people, chasing balls, playing with squeaky toys, and enjoying a chew toy. Nova has lived with small and large dogs previously. She's awaiting her new home today!</p><p><br></p><p><u>From her foster parents: </u></p><p><br></p><p>Nova is an extremely sweet and curious dog who loves to be involved in every single conversation and is always eager to receive cuddles and praise. She loves eating kibbles and will drink lots of water when she's thirsty after long walks! She can be a little picky about her treats – for instance, she does not love peanut butter treats so you may need to experiment. Nova is shockingly tolerating of baths, but she does not love getting her paws and eyes cleaned.</p><p><br></p><p>Nova loves running after balls but does not yet know how to retrieve them (maybe you can teach her!). She loves cars and car rides, and she is learning not to jump and lick when she is excited (to see you!). She may proudly carry your socks to you as a gift, and we still don't know why! She loves to sleep with you but can be trained not to if you don't want her on the bed. She is a little apprehensive of kids and may bark if they get too close. Nova is also protective of you and will bark at strangers in your home, but she becomes friendly when you tell her it's okay. She cares a lot about her people and will run over to help if you seem unwell.</p><p><br></p><p>Nova loves going on walks but is also very happy to stay home (where she naps and plays). She will run over and sit whenever she hears you pick up the leash! She is also really good at 'sit', especially if you have treats. She is super smart, so with lots of praises and treats, she can learn many more commands! She is very curious and will sniff most things unless it's a mop – in which case she will hide behind you because she is scared of mops!</p><p><br></p><p>She loves following you around the house, but is not anxious to be by herself at home and responds very calmly to being in the crate. When we are outside, Nova makes sure that everyone is included, rushing home whenever someone is left behind! If she does not see you, she may also check every single car in the garage to make sure that you are not in there :)</p>",

He absolutely loves spending time playing in the yard, showing off his playful and goofy side.</p><p>With a medium energy level, Dom would be a great match for an active lifestyle, and he’ll likely relax even more once he’s out of the shelter environment.

    "description_html": "<h3>Meet Clara Bow (aka Bowie)</h3><p>Hi, I’m <strong>Clara Bow</strong>, but my friends call me <strong>Bowie</strong> - because I’m full of star power and a little bit of sparkle! I’m a young, happy girl (about 70 lbs) who loves people, other dogs, and pretty much everything about life. I bring sunshine wherever I go.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>My Favorite Things</h3><p>I’m <strong>house-trained</strong>, love <strong>walks</strong>, <strong>car rides</strong>, and <strong>playing with my dog friends</strong>. I get along great with both dogs and cats (yep, I’m that well-rounded). During the day, I like to explore, play with toys, or hang out with my foster brother. At night, I’ll curl up next to you - I’m a world-class snuggler.</p><p><br></p><h3>My Personality</h3><p>I’ve got that <strong>fun, goofy, young dog energy</strong>, so I’m looking for a family who is able to spend time with me to play. Whether it's with walks, yard time, adventures (bars, coffee shops pet stores, and playing tug-of-war, or another dog, I love living life and exploring. I’m working on my commands and doing great, but I’m young, curious, and sometimes a little “mouthy” when I get excited (never aggressive - just young dog enthusiasm). A patient person that has experience with dogs would be great. I also think I'd be ok with a family that has older kids! I have experience with my foster mom's nieces and nephews who are really young, so that could work too but older kids will be better able to help train me :)</p><p><br></p><h3>My Quirks (aka My Charms)</h3><p>Like any dog who’s had to look out for herself, I <em>really</em> love food. Mealtime is the best part of my day, and sometimes I like to “help” by checking if you’ve dropped anything tasty when you're eating. I’ve also been known to “borrow” things around the house - socks, shoes, pens, you name it - just for fun and to see if they're edible. Everyone needs a hobby, right?</p><p><br></p><h3>What I’m Looking For</h3><p>I’d love a forever home with someone who:</p><ul><li>Has experience with dogs is a must!</li><li>Can spend time playing with me</li><li>Ideally has another dog friend for me to romp around with</li><li>Preferably has a house with a yard or works from home if they're in an apartment. Someone who can dedicate the first couple of weeks to making sure I know you're coming back.*</li></ul><p><br></p><p>*I was adopted once before for just a day, but was returned. I got really scared when I found myself alone in a brand new apartment and without my dog friend. I barked a lot because I didn’t understand what was happening. My adopter worked in an office four days a week and lived in an apartment, so they were worried about that. I don't do this with my current family who has a house and a cat/dog, but if adopted I just need someone patient who understands that adjusting takes me a little time, but once I feel at home I become confident.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">If you’re looking for a loyal, funny, affectionate companion who’ll make every day brighter, </span><strong style=\"background-color: transparent;\">I might just be your Bowie!</strong></p>",

Friendly, calm, and incredibly affectionate, he greets people with a loose, wiggly body, soft eyes, and a happy tail. Within minutes, he’s handing out kisses, leaning in for pets, and soaking up attention like he’s known you forever.</p><p><br></p><p>This sweet boy loves toys — especially soft toys and tennis balls — and will proudly bring them over to show off. In playtime rooms, he’s playful and happy, but he also knows how to relax and enjoy cuddles, belly rubs, and butt scratches. Volunteers consistently describe him as incredibly easy, well-mannered, and one of the most house-trained dogs they’ve met in the shelter.</p><p><br></p><p>Tigger walks beautifully on leash and is very responsive to direction and cues. He knows how to sit, is treat-motivated, and does well transitioning in and out of his kennel. While he may show mild excitement when he sees other dogs, it’s friendly curiosity — he’s non-reactive passing kennels and even stops to give sweet greetings through the gate, complete with wiggly tails and nose kisses.</p><p><br></p><p>He enjoys sniffing around, spending time with people, and would thrive in a home that offers love, routine, and maybe a few good toys to toss around. A house with a yard would be wonderful, but Tigger could also do well in an apartment with regular walks and enrichment.</p><p><br></p><p>Tigger is a laid-back cuddler with a playful side — a truly special dog who’s ready to be someone’s best friend.</p><p><br></p><p>💫 Good on leash</p><p>💫 House-trained</p><p>💫 Affectionate &amp; cuddly</p><p>💫 Toy-loving</p><p>💫 Easy, gentle companion</p><p><br></p><p>If you’re looking for a sweet, loving dog who will adore you back tenfold, Tigger might just be your guy. 🐾💙</p>",

He’s housetrained, listens well, walks calmly on leash (and loves to find a good stick to carry), and is loving all the cozy naps and endless toys. He would love to have a playful dog sibling to run around with and a human lap to sit in (he would prefer the lap is big enough for him so kids 10+ please)!</p><p><br></p><p>Bobby came in to the shelter at just 4 months old. He was completely hairless, wounded, and sick. He’s been working on his glow up and now has the softest fur all over.

On leash, she’s a strong puller and loves to puppy-run in all directions, but she responds well to redirection and stays focused even with lots of distractions.

She’s clumsy in the most endearing way, loves climbing right into your lap (despite being far too big for it), has </span><em style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">zero</em><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> concept of personal space and will definitely stare at you like you’re her favorite person in the world. Personal space? Never heard of it.

She’s house-trained and crate-trained, has never had an accident indoors, and sleeps soundly through the night. She may whine a bit when you leave or head upstairs (she’s just making sure you remember how much she loves you), but she’s improving as she gains confidence and trust.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">She’s shown interest in other dogs and has been friendly with neighborhood pups, though she can get a bit too excited during greetings. Penny would thrive in a home where she gets plenty of attention, consistent training, and space to zoom around.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">She’s a medium-energy girl who needs time to play, but she’s just as happy to curl up beside you for hours.

She had been left behind in the washroom of an apartment building, heavily matted into a large fur ball. We don't believe she was ever left outdoors. Someone taught this sweet baby love, they simply did not have the ability to care for her.</p><p>\n</p><p>She's spayed and heartworm negative. Her weight is perfect. Her matts have been shaved off and for the first time in years she is walking on her real paws, she can feel wind on her skin, her body is capable of full stretches, she can run and fully \"feel\" again. With that comes time to adjust to her new body and touch, requiring understanding, patience and light management by her VIPs. She loves love and has a spirit that will warm your soul, but can be subject to occasional startles--her body is new to her..</p><p>\n</p><p>Lady Pablo seems to be very content near cats.</p><p>She's had limited engagement with dogs and seems to mostly co-exist, although we think she would prefer to have all of the people attention for herself.</p><p>\n</p><p>Her ideal person or people will have some experience with small dogs that need a little extra help and guidance in life, It's her turn to catch up for all the years she's lost out on.</p><p>\n</p><p>Interested in learning more?</p><p>Click on her link to reach her foster parents.</p>",

She spent much of her early puppyhood healing and recovering on crate rest. But she is now healed up, good as new and thriving in foster! Goldie is a lovely Belgian Shepherd mix and a sweet little goofball and will grow up to be an elegant, long-legged blonde!&nbsp;If she was a person, she'd be a supermodel! At 7 months old she is about 40 pounds and will likely top out around 60 pounds She can be a little shy meeting new humans, but warms up quickly. She recently attended several busy adoption events full of new people, dogs, sights and sounds and Goldie was a perfect little lady and behaved beautifully. She was great with all the kids who stopped to pet her as well. She is about 99% potty trained and she's a natural at walking on a loose leash! She loves to play with other dogs and wears out her two big canine foster brothers running around the yard. She has been around a cat and wanted to play with it. But she's still a puppy and can adapt to living with cats. This sweet little lady would make a stellar family dog and a great active buddy for anyone looking for a pup that is equal parts energetic adventurer and snugglebug!&nbsp;Could she be your dreamgirl???</p>",

Cillian was a very independent cat in his previous home. He's low-maintenance and there may be times you don't even know he's there! But, Cillian will choose his moments for snuggles and he does enjoy pets. His one weakness might be shoelaces. He loves to chew them, so put your shoes away and get this guy a proper wand toy! He's lived with other cats and dogs so may do well in a multi-pet home.</p>",

Her ears are luxurious, her tail is super wags. I found her on the streets a couple months ago, her history is unknown - she's on a grand adventure and looking for her forever people. Her top priorities are snuggles and pillow princess naps, and activities such as supervising squirrels and sticks, and rumpus time with toys or dog friends. Flora loves doing whatever you're doing. She's well-behaved and engaged on walks, plays well with my dog, and learns games and tricks easily. If left to her own devices, she'll make a nest of any available pillows and chill. She's untested with children, but she's a mama, very gentle and sweet with everyone. Flora is housetrained, solid on basic commands, treat motivated and eager to please. She's working on leash reactivity, and responding well to redirection. Flora is so chill, when you give her a loving home she'll be happy with the daily activities of your household. Flora is spayed and chipped, up to date on vaccinations, and takes Symparica Trio monthly. She's in great shape, no known conditions.</span></p>",

    "description_html": "<p>Sully was found as a stray near the HEB by William cannon and I-35. Not much is known about his life before this moment, but he has made quite the impression in the short time we have had him. From the moment we set eye on him he was a happy gentleman, sitting calmly outside HEB. He accepted food gently, and belly rubs with great enthusiasm. Since that moment Sully has proven to be a mild mannered, medium to low energy dog, who is grateful to be inside and willing to accept any love shown to him. He has met many people, tons of dogs and one sassy cat, and each time he is polite, calm and friendly. He gently wrestles with our high energy dog, but ultimately loves to flop over on his back during play and just wiggle on the ground. He does not resource guard but he is food motivated for training, and he walks well on leash. He doesn’t bark inside and will generally only bark outside if left alone, he for the most part just wants his human close by. He is willing to cuddle, but could easily be trained to stay off furniture as for the most part he just lays on the floor or his dog bed. Again he is calm with cats!! He shows mild interest in our cat but responds well to being redirected or even disciplined by the cat.i would recommend a slow introduction to be safe, but he is very gentle and just a giant lovable oaf. He has also played well and been friendly with every dog he has been introduced to. As a large unfixed male, this was something we were worried about initially, but as with everything else he has exceeded our expectations. And he will be fixed soon, so that will likely calm him even more.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Sully could do well in any environment but I believe his perfect home would be him with a kind family that maybe has a pet or two for him to be friends with. He would love a home where people are around and spending time with him or bringing him out on lots of walks. He deserves to be around people and loved and spoiled every day. Sully would not do well in a home where he is kept outside or as more of an outdoor dog, as he is a prince and deserves to be treated as such.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>He is about 2 years old, in good health but heart worm positive. He is fully house trained, good with dogs and cats, children unknown but I have a strong sense he would be as gentle with them as every other person he has met. He is medium to low energy, but likes to play, and is opening up more everyday. So far he doesn’t jump or lick and has very good manners meeting new people. He is a great dog who deserves a very loving family</p>",

    "description_html": "<p>Hi, my name is Holly, or Holly Doll as my mom likes to call me. I guess she always tells me that I am such a doll…whatever that means. I want to start off by saying that I am really, really laid back. I think they call me a lap dog, which I laugh at, because I really am too big for your lap, but I enjoy snuggling up all close to you and laying in your lap and giving you tons of affection.&nbsp;I do love playing with my big Boxer sister, but I look forward to my downtime where I can stretch my body out and just relax. I will get along with any dog really, as I am mild mannered and incredibly respectful of their space, food, toys and treats.</p><p>I do love a good squeaky toy every now and then, too. I enjoy my walks and I am very, very good on a leash. I get so excited when I see people or other dogs when I am out, but I cannot help it, I enjoy the attention and want to play!! &nbsp;I am working on controlling my excitement though – which is no fun. I appear to be good with kids, although I don’t currently live with any, but my mom can tell how happy I get when we see kids out and about. I wag my tail really fast and tap my feet and try to pull her near them. I don’t know if I am good with cats either. I do not currently live with any and we haven’t come across any on my walks. I can keep you posted though. </p><p>I am crate, leash, house and potty trained. I learn very quickly and I love the one-on-one time I get with my mom when she is teaching me. &nbsp;I am not a big barker, although my Boxer sister sometimes tries to get me to join in with her, but I can resist. I like riding in cars and will jump right in to go anywhere.</p><p>Overall, I am a wonderful pup. I can have little bursts of puppy energy, but for most of the day, I am laid back. I am super friendly and sweet. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

    "description_html": "<p>Meet Chip! Chip is a curious yet gentle bunny who enjoys exploring and spending time around people on his own terms. He likes to approach for attention and investigation, then retreat to his pen when he's ready to relax. Chip communicates clearly when he needs space, so he'd do best with someone who understands and respects bunny boundaries. He loves head and back rubs, but prefers not to have his feet or belly touched and does not enjoy being picked up. Carrots are his favorite treat, while bananas are a definite no! Chip can be sensitive to loud noises, so a calm home without very young children or dogs would suit him best. With the right introduction, he may also be a good candidate for bonding with another rabbit. Overall, Chip is a sweet, thoughtful bunny who will thrive in a patient, loving home that lets him blossom at his own pace. 🐰💛</p>",

He’s still young and full of classic puppy energy, but he’s already surprisingly good on leash and can walk nicely with a licki mat or treats for support. Biscuit can be a little jumpy (as puppies are!) and is sensitive to loud barking, especially in dark or busy environments, but he shows clear signs of curiosity and playfulness around other dogs rather than fear.</p><p>With consistent exercise, enrichment, and positive-reinforcement training, Biscuit is going to grow into a fantastic companion. He’ll thrive with adopters or fosters who understand that puppies take time, patience, and daily mental and physical outlets—but the payoff will be huge.</p><p>Sweet, eager, and ready to learn, Biscuit is a baby with big potential just waiting to be unlocked.&nbsp;</p>",

Her mouser skills are incredible — Minnie hunkers down, pupils wide, tracking every twitch of the feathers until just the right moment to SPRINT into action. On carpet or a rug, she has impressive speed and agility! And when that “bird” takes flight, Minnie transforms into a (still overwhelmingly adorable) fierce aerial hunter, launching into the air with entertaining acrobatics to pluck her prey out of the sky. Her second favorite game to play involves a donut shaped tunnel with two entry points. She will dash into it, and if you tease the outside of the tunnel with a stick or fabric covered wire (in our case), she goes absolutely berserk attacking it from within— make absolutely sure you don’t touch the tunnel with any part of your body because she is in the ZONE!! You’ll be so entertained as she uses her claws to pull herself around the tunnel on her back! She’s such a funny little playmate!</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Minnie came to us off the street, but she clearly was raised by humans, as she wants to spend as much time with them as possible. She is very vocal, and loves to talk to you. She has all sorts of thoughts about everything! If only we could understand what those thoughts are… If you work from home, Minnie is going to be your reliable coworker, always there to give you a little hit of dopamine or oxytocin throughout your day. As you stare into your monitor, Minnie will curl up in your lap, especially if you have a blanket there. When she’s not napping, she will explore your desk, passing by to rub her face on your chin. Her loves are a fantastic pick-me-up throughout the day!</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Minnie gets along great with other cats, especially if given a metered introduction. She would love to have a friendly playmate!</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">If you’re looking for a lovey, playful companion, Minnie is your little gal!! Come meet her and let her steal your heart!!</span></p>",

She's still likely to hiss if approached too quickly and be tightened up as hard as a rock when you touch her, but with some dedication I have gotten her to start relaxing during pets and even put her chin up and press into some neck and chin scritches. Definitely can't pick her up with your hands, but placing a blanket or towel over her makes her limp enough to handle and transport her. I believe she can be domesticated and put into a good home, but it will take continued work. Named Persephone because I got two kittens from her the year before these four kittens, so she was like Persephone coming back from the underworld every year bringing me new pretty babies. She has now been spayed to end that cycle!</p>",

He also loves cuddles. His energy level is low to medium with the occasional daily burst of energy to play fetch or squish a tennis ball for instance. He rides well in the car. He's refining all his indoor skills beautifully - we don't know how long he lived outdoors. If you would like to meet up, please apply on his link - there's no commitment and a trip to the shelter is not required unless you would like to have a doggie meet up which will be scheduled there after meeting Hot Dog in person.</p>",

    "description_html": "<p>Maisy is a 2 year old heeler/lab mix with a big heart and big energy! She is extremely sweet, smart, willing, and quick to learn new behaviors. Not much is known about her history, and she is still very much like a puppy learning the ropes. As is typical for her breed, she has a high energy level and can be a bit anxious in unknown situations, but she has never shown any aggression- mostly excitement at new things, or occasional timidness about being in a new space!</p><p><br></p><p>She is extremely gentle about taking treats and does not get upset if you mess with her food dish while she is eating.&nbsp;&nbsp;She is a bit of a grazer and will often leave some of the food in her slow feeder bowl and come back later to finish it. She also enjoys getting a portion of her food out of a \"treat dispenser\" ball. While she hasn't quite mastered \"drop it,\" she will allow you to remove things from her mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>Maisy is friendly with dogs and might benefit from a calm, well-adjusted dog to help her learn the household routines. She is learning to be around cats in her foster home, but they do make her anxious when they dart around, so introductions would have to be slow. As of 1/10/26, after just a week in her foster home, she has learned to sit or lie down when she is near cats and allow them to approach, but will still sometimes jump up and try to chase if they run away. She has not been tested with kids but loves every new person she meets. I think she would do best with older children just because she is still learning how big she is.</p><p><br></p><p>Maisy would definitely benefit from a lot of mental stimulation, such as scent-work. Right now she tends to be more meandering on walks, but she might enjoy running with someone who took the time to train her. Once she's got her energy out, she's happy to snuggle on the couch (she thinks she's a lap dog!) or sit quietly with a chew toy. Sometimes when she is feeling overwhelmed she will nibble on your clothes but is easily redirected to a toy.</p><p><br></p><p>Maisy is good in her crate and has never had an accident in the house since we’ve had her. She knows how to ask to go out and to come back in by sitting quietly at the door. She loves being outside watching the squirrels, and rolling in leaf piles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On walks she does not&nbsp;&nbsp;pull but likes to investigate new sights, sounds, and smells and will sometimes stop and stare to take it all in.</p><p><br></p><p>Maisy is currently on medication to help with her anxiety adjusting to her new life, and is making huge improvements every day.</p><p><br></p><p>If you're looking for a really smart, energetic, sweet, and willing-to-please girl who just needs some \"finishing,\" Maisy just might be your girl!</p>",
