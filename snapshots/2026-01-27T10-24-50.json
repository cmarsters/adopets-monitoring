    "description_html": "<p>Who loves movie night?! Jade does and she's looking for a couch potato buddy. She's also the hostess with the mostest - she loves having people over and is great at making sure everyone feels welcome! Her foster friends say, \"Jade is house trained and low key in the house. She is not destructive &amp; can be left alone, and she enjoys cuddling but is not super pushy. This girl loves to nap and loves to eat! AKA she is super easy to please. She also sleeps through the night like a gem and has to be woken up by her humans for breakfast. Jade lived with a toddler for 2 weeks and was incredibly gentle. Jade loves to sunbathe and chill in the backyard. She gets excited to zoom around when given the opportunity, but then reverts back to her calm, cuddly self in the house. Jade's only \"difficult\" trait, which I assume is the reason she has yet to be adopted, is that she does need to be in an only pet home. However, with a family with a yard and no other pets, she would be the easiest dog ever and best companion!\"</p>",

Bambi is house trained, not destructive, and great in a kennel for long periods of time. She has a good balance of energy to play in the yard and a healthy love for napping. She will greet you every morning with full body wiggles and a smile! (Yes, an actual smile!) Bambi knows how to sit and how to go get in her spot, whether that's her bed or her spot on the couch. She has been taught food manners; she will sit and wait until you say yes before eating her meal. She is very food motivated, which is great for training and nail trimming, but don't leave food trash out because she'll happily vacuum up every last morsel! She gently accepts treats and doesn't beg while you finish a meal; a true lady. She would be a great family dog as she does well around older kids. She is dog selective, but has lived with other well-matched dogs. She loves car rides and will sit well in the front or the back seat. She even enjoys the window down a little bit! Fun facts about Bambi are she does well around farm animals, can bounce on a trampoline, and only barks at the scary Amazon delivery man! Bambi was in the shelter for a long period of time, but has really opened up in foster care to show what a sweet and loving girl she is. Please reach out if you're ready to give this sweet girl the forever home she's looking for!</p>",

    "description_html": "Geedorah (GeeGee for short) has the most striking eyes. Combine those eyes with fun merle spots on her head and she's one beautiful pup!\r\n\r\nThis sweet gal starts out a little shy then really starts to shine once she gets to know you, accepting gentle pets and nicely taking treats. GeeGee loves other dogs-she immediately became fast friends with her foster brother, running around the backyard and playing. She likes but is also respectful of her two elderly, smaller foster sisters when they don't want to play. She was a little interested in her foster guinea pig siblings at first, but once they were shown to her up close, she lost interest. So no problem for her if there are small animals in the house.\r\n\r\nMiss GeeGee is a smart cookie. She learned the dog door in two days from watching her siblings. She's also crate trained and is comfortable in her crate overnight or during the day when her people are at work.\r\n\r\nIf you like walks, this girl can be your best buddy! She easily keeps up with her foster mom for 2-3 miles. GeeGee is also happy to chill with her family. She's really starting to enjoy and seek out couch cuddles both with her people and her foster siblings. The middle of a cuddle puddle is now one of her favorite spots! Geedorah can also entertain herself with toys (stuffies and ropes) and chew treats like benebones. Since she's four years old, she's past the crazy puppy energy but still has many years to love her forever family.\r\n\r\nAt a compact 35 pounds, Geedorah is the perfect size for any household. Come meet this amazing girl and fall in love with your new best friend!\r\n\r\nCheck out Geedorah's Instagram: @adopt_GeeGee_dog",

My foster parents gave me that name since I spent my life being so powerless, now it is my time to learn what it's like to have power. I had a very rough first half of life, and am ready to be loved. I finished all of my medical treatment and am a very healthy boy. I am starting to realize the world isn't so scary. I am still a bit nervous, but love being pet and chilling out with a chew stick. I like to stay glued to someone's leg when I am on the leash and am great about going to the bathroom outside. My foster cat and dog brothers are both spooky to me even when they stand still so I ignore them. My foster rabbit brother isn't as scary to me though. I am gaining a love for life and am looking for my forever human or humans to spend the rest of my life with. I will be your sweetest and most loyal family member!</p>",

He's living in a foster home where he's proven to be very housetrained, for a full work day. He enjoys the security of his crate sometimes  and isn't anxious at all to be left alone and simply sleeps the time away. He does enjoy sleeping by his person if allowed. He likes baths and has learned a love of some toys and short zoomie sessions in the yard. He's been a joy for his foster to watch unfold now that he doesn't have to figure out the basics of life for himself. Reach out to learn more. He's had some light experience around dogs including a smaller dog, and has not yet met cats. A meet and greet with a resident dog can be scheduled at the shelter.

Draco is looking for a family who will spend time with him, building his confidence and teaching him about the world. He's a very sweet boy that so wants to be with his people.</p><p>We think Draco would make a great around town pup, that you could take anywhere that's pet friendly. He loves to play in water!

He's a sensitive soul that would make a special companion to any household. He crates himself for meals to wait on his food. And Draco knows Sit, Bed, Touch, and can sometimes Stay.</p><p>So, if you're looking for a friend till the end, then Draco is your boy!</p><p>If you have any questions, please reach out to orangedotcrew@gmail.com to kickstart this heartwarming journey.

Meet&nbsp;<strong>Sunshine,&nbsp;</strong>a six-year-old cattle dog/border collie mix who is 40% brilliance, 40% sass, and 20% “ma’am, this is a Wendy’s.”</p><p>At the shelter, Sunshine expresses her feelings through&nbsp;<em>Bark</em>, the ancient language of the Extremely Stressed. She performs this opera for anyone within a three-block radius. But it’s only because the shelter is a stressful place to be, and Sunshine knows she doesn’t belong here. She knows she is meant to live a life of leisure with humans who love her and keep her well stocked with treats and toys, and she will continue her protest of living here through barking loudly to ask to speak to the manager.&nbsp;</p><p>Once she’s out of the shelter? She transforms. Suddenly she’s a polite, leash-walking, car-riding, house-trained queen (who only barks sometimes when she spots other dogs or animals, but in fairness to Sunshine, why are there ducks and geese at the park??)&nbsp;</p><p>Sunshine is not here for your nonsense. She demands an adopter who appreciates a woman with boundaries, personality, a strong sense of fashion, and just a hint of chaos. She is affectionate, loyal, occasionally dramatic, and fully prepared to narrate the neighborhood gossip from your front window. She expects daily cuddle sessions, the last bite of whatever you’re eating, and for the photos saved on your phone to exclusively document her beauty.&nbsp;</p><p>Sunshine doesn’t want to be perfect; she wants to be&nbsp;<strong>iconic</strong>. And she is.</p><p>If you’re ready to embrace a dog who sparkles, snuggles, and sasses her way into your heart, head to Austin Animal Services&nbsp;to meet Sunshine. She’s waiting to charm you… loudly at first, and then forever.&nbsp;</p><p>Email her agents at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:blueplusbusters@gmail.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(66, 133, 244);\">blueplusbusters@gmail.com</a>&nbsp;to bring some Sunshine into your life.&nbsp;</p>",

Alfred is social with other dogs, does well with cats, and enjoys playing fetch, zooming around the yard, and keeping watch from his favorite window.\r\n\r\nAthletic and graceful, Alfred runs like a gazelle but is just as happy soaking up ear scratches and butt rubs. With his brains, heart, and personality, he's ready to be a wonderful companion for the right family. 🐾",

In his current foster home, he free-roams like the responsible adult he is. No chewed furniture, no chaos—just good boy vibes. He’s even been left alone for long stretches and handled it like a champ.</p><p>Benji lives with a male dog and LOVES having a play buddy. When his dog friend isn’t in the mood, Benji has no problem entertaining himself with toys, bones, and solo playtime. When meeting new dogs, he sometimes comes in a little… enthusiastic. Think “Hi!Hi!Hi!Let’sBeBestFriends!” right out of the gate. With proper introductions, he’s thrilled to make doggy friends.</p><p>Despite his playful energy, Benji takes his beauty rest very seriously and fits naps into his daily schedule like a true professional. He is a <strong>HUGE cuddle bug</strong> and firmly believes couches and beds exist <em>specifically</em> for snuggling. On work-from-home days, he’ll either quietly entertain himself or snooze right next to your desk as your emotional support coworker.</p><p>Benji is also a total people-lover. Friends coming over? Best day ever. Male, female, doesn’t matter—Benji is excited to say hello and will quickly wiggle his way into snuggle position on the couch.</p><p><br></p><p>If you’re looking for a dog who’s playful, affectionate, low-drama at home, and always down to cuddle, Benji is ready to move in and steal your heart (and probably your spot on the couch). </p>",

Bunny can now do everything that dogs do - besides being a great guest at home, she's house trained, she enjoys a little yard time and sunshine on her face. Short walks for exercise help her muscle strength. She's also a fish while guided in a swimming pool. She gives and receives so many affections. She's earned a reputation as a lap dog.</p><p><br></p><p>Bunny has a condition that makes her wobbly and unsteady on her feet, but she is aided by standard traction helpers like rugs, mats and being on flat surfaces when outdoors.

No repeats, just good boy energy from then on.</p><p>He explored the home calmly, played with <em>every</em> squeaky toy, and then curled up on the couch for a cozy nap. When a familiar friend came to visit, Chicharrón greeted her with happy wiggles and calm excitement—clearly a dog who knows how to balance joy and manners.</p><p>He also did great in the car, hopping right in, entertaining himself with toys in the backseat, and taking in the world through the window with quiet curiosity.</p><p>Chicharrón is the total package: house-savvy, leash-lovin’, toy-obsessed, and full of affection.

She requires a large litterbox so that she doesn't miss (her foster dad customized one, and it goes with her when she's adopted). \r\n\r\nRoo is an extremely happy, affectionate cat. She is playful (her fave is a wand toy), and she loves nothing more than to be in a lap and snuggle. She walks around well on tile floors, but she does best on carpeting. She can't jump or climb, so a low window that she can look out would be ideal.\r\n\r\nI am a DHC, and I have my own webpage: http://www.desperatehousecats.info/flyers/Roo7099.pdf\r\n\r\nThe adoption fee is waived for Roo and all Desperate Housecats!\r\n",

I don’t bark much, and when my foster dad leaves, I happily go into my crate and relax until he comes back.

He enjoys having a variety of toys to play with, but doing so right next to his people. He’s a multitasker who likes to play and snuggle at the same time. His signature move on a couch is to put his butt in the air and his head in your lap. This sweetheart is a bouncy ball of fun. At the shelter he loves going for walks, playing fetch in the play yards, or snuggling in the real life rooms.</p><p><br></p><p>Emmitt is also very house trained and knows a few tricks. He’s always up for a snack which make adding new tricks to his resume a breeze.</p><p><br></p><p>We’d love to see Emmitt in a home with daily walks, a bit of fetch, a full belly, and some extra snuggles.</p>",

    "description_html": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">Sweet, silly, and affectionate, Ellie is the most beautiful golden girl looking for a soft place to land and a family to call her own. On the labrador retriever color spectrum, one might say she lands somewhere between \"lightly toasted\" and \"golden.\" She has the most adorable ears (one that sticks up and the other that flops over) and the cutest docked tail. She is currently housed with an older, mellow dog and a younger, active dog. She is a fantastic dog friend because she knows how to match the energy and respect the boundaries of anyone she plays with. Ellie is house-trained, walks well on leash, and is relatively quiet (not a big barker from what her foster parents can&nbsp;tell). She is non-destructive when left alone in the home, and sleeps well throughout the night. When out and about she has met babies, toddlers, teens, and seniors, and has done well with everyone. Her favorite things include walks, napping, car rides, playing, and belly rubs! If you decide to stop petting her, be prepared for her to ask for \"more pets, please!\" Ellie is not a fan of rabbits, cats, confining spaces, or loud sudden&nbsp;noises.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">Because not a whole lot is known about her past, Ellie can still be shy in new situations and around people she doesn't know. In these situations, usually a high-value treat and a little patience goes a long way to winning her over. Ellie would thrive in a home where she can demand all the belly rubs her heart desires, a doggy (or human) friend, and a cozy place to curl up. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">Click \"Get Started\" to connect with this beautiful pup in person!</span></p>",

    "description_html": "<p>🐾 Meet Mr. Franco - Your Gentle Giant in Training! 🐾 Looking for an adolescent pup who's already house, potty, and crate trained? Good with dog-savvy kids? Happy to chill by your side while you work or watch TV? Full of personality and gets along with other dogs? Then Mr. Franco might just be your unicorn! Franco is a big-hearted goofball who doesn't quite realize his own size. He's the perfect mix of cuddly and calm, with bursts of excited energy when it's time to play, especially with people, pups, or when there's food involved. Franco was recently in foster care, where he worked hard on his recall, patience, and manners. Like many tall boys, he's been known to counter-surf, but his foster mom assures us: \"We're working on it!\" Hand him a toy or a bone, and Franco's in heaven. 🏡 Ideal Home: Franco will thrive in a home that can offer him a balance of activity and downtime-think daily walks or dog park play, followed by some solid couch cuddles. Due to his size and puppy energy, we recommend a home without cats and without very young children, unless they're experienced with dogs.</p>",

He's still learning how to walk nicely on a leash, but he's eager to improve. Overall, Hank's a sweet goofball who just needs a wonderful home to share his love!",

Inside, he is calm and surrounds himself with as many squeak toys as possible. Though a young boy, he spends most of the day chilled with afternoons reserved for a long siesta. No problems with deer just outside the fence but the occasional squirrel will grab his attention. Though Buddy spends most of the day inside given the high outdoor temps, in the evening and early morning he enjoys being outside watching the world pass. The highlight of the day is his walk. His lease etiquette is being worked on but drastically improved over a short period of time (about 70% there). Buddy understands and obeys basic commands (stay, sit, laydown, off). If he does become excited inside, a simple command to laydown works every time. He is very respectful of the two other dogs living in the house even the little one who often try's to dominate. Too, it's amazing how little he sheds, especially compared to the other two we have but this could change throughout the year. Overall a very obedient calm boy who would love to have someone to play or spend time outside.</p>",

He is crate &amp; potty trained, and does very well just sitting on the porch or while we watch tv! He's very well behaved, knows \"sit\", \"down\", \"stay\", &amp; \"place\" (his crate &amp; bed). He loves tug of war, hide &amp; seek, and long morning &amp; evening walks. Still a young pup, he needs long walks &amp; play time to tire out his mind &amp; body - we've been walking around 3-4 miles a day! Although he does get very excited on walks &amp; pulls a bit to sniff all the smells, &amp; play with all the dogs (usually he can walk past with some peaked interest, but sometimes he does get real excited and itches to play with a very light whine and jump - were working on his focus &amp; distractions with treats + positive reinforcement when he looks up at us or checks in) with some consistent training &amp; socialization I'm certain he'd keep his attention at bay in no time! Despite his happy go lucky spirit, Disco also knows how to chill at home. He's easy to get in his crate, will sleep next to you for hours during a mellow day, and overall just loves laying down close to people. He's just about 50lbs and shouldn't grow much more, so he's perfect to take in the car (his car manners are perfect) and on adventures! Disco would be a wonderful fit for an active home willing to dedicate some time towards cuddles, tug-of-war, + a little bit of discipline &amp; consistency!</p>",

Everyone that meets him comments on how chill he is and how sweet his personality is.</p><p><br></p><p>Bear is an absolute gentleman in the home. He is<strong> </strong>potty trained and crate trained,<strong> </strong>though he would much prefer to be your \"bed hog\" if you’ll allow it! He actually jumps into the bathtub by himself and sits patiently for nail trims. He loves car rides and is ready for any road trip.</p><p><br></p><p>Bear is incredibly smart and highly food-motivated, which has made training a breeze. He already boasts an impressive resume of commands like: sit, stay, touch, leave it, come, shake, pound it!, lay down, and soon to be much more! He is amazing on a leash.</p><p><br></p><p>Because of his rough start, Bear can fearful of new people.. He needs a slow introduction to strangers; while he will bravely take treats and follow commands from new friends, he prefers not to be petted until he knows he can trust you. Once you are in his \"inner circle,\" he is a velcro dog who would follow you to the end of the earth.</p><p><br></p><p>Bear’s Ideal Forever Home:</p><ul><li><strong>Presence:</strong> Someone who is home more often than not to give him the reassurance he craves. He'd love to live with another dog(s) to continue to help build his confidence.</li><li><strong>Patience:</strong> A family willing to advocate for his space during introductions.</li><li><strong>Love:</strong> Plenty of couch space for snuggles and pets.</li><li><strong>Note on Cats &amp; Kids:</strong> Bear is looking for a <strong>no-cat (ideally)</strong> household (though he lives with them at his Foster who can provide further info) and a home <strong>without young children</strong>, as he prefers a calm, predictable environment.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Bear survived the streets, and now he’s ready to survive a long nap on a soft bed next to his favorite person(s).

She likes to bounce her way out of the kennel because she's so excited to leave it! Once outside this affectionate girl enjoys cuddles and play time. Marley lived with another dog at the shelter for a bit so may enjoy the company of another dog at home! We would love to see sweet Marley in foster care if she isn't adopted soon.</p>",

The moment he steps outside, he happily nudges his head between your legs for pets and affection.

Volunteers describe him as an easy, loving companion who’s just happy to be by your side.</p><p><br></p><p>Wrigley does well with most dogs who share his soft, gentle play style. He also thrives in a home setting, where he shows off his goofy, playful side. Though he isn’t especially treat-motivated, his eagerness to connect with people makes him a joy to work with. He does have a high prey drive, so he’ll need supervision when wildlife is around and may be best suited to a home without cats or other small animals.</p>",

    "description_html": "<p>Nova was surrendered due to their owner's living arrangement changing. She's Smart, loyal, sweet, and playful. She's a very good girl for baths, too! Nova's favorite things are taking walks with her people, chasing balls, playing with squeaky toys, and enjoying a chew toy. Nova has lived with small and large dogs previously. She's awaiting her new home today!</p><p><br></p><p><u>From her foster parents: </u></p><p><br></p><p>Nova is an extremely sweet and curious dog who loves to be involved in every single conversation and is always eager to receive cuddles and praise. She loves eating kibbles and will drink lots of water when she's thirsty after long walks! She can be a little picky about her treats – for instance, she does not love peanut butter treats so you may need to experiment. Nova is shockingly tolerating of baths, but she does not love getting her paws and eyes cleaned.</p><p><br></p><p>Nova loves running after balls but does not yet know how to retrieve them (maybe you can teach her!). She loves cars and car rides, and she is learning not to jump and lick when she is excited (to see you!). She may proudly carry your socks to you as a gift, and we still don't know why! She loves to sleep with you but can be trained not to if you don't want her on the bed. She is a little apprehensive of kids and may bark if they get too close. Nova is also protective of you and will bark at strangers in your home, but she becomes friendly when you tell her it's okay. She cares a lot about her people and will run over to help if you seem unwell.</p><p><br></p><p>Nova loves going on walks but is also very happy to stay home (where she naps and plays). She will run over and sit whenever she hears you pick up the leash! She is also really good at 'sit', especially if you have treats. She is super smart, so with lots of praises and treats, she can learn many more commands! She is very curious and will sniff most things unless it's a mop – in which case she will hide behind you because she is scared of mops!</p><p><br></p><p>She loves following you around the house, but is not anxious to be by herself at home and responds very calmly to being in the crate. When we are outside, Nova makes sure that everyone is included, rushing home whenever someone is left behind! If she does not see you, she may also check every single car in the garage to make sure that you are not in there :)</p>",

He absolutely loves spending time playing in the yard, showing off his playful and goofy side.</p><p>With a medium energy level, Dom would be a great match for an active lifestyle, and he’ll likely relax even more once he’s out of the shelter environment.

Within minutes, he’s handing out kisses, leaning in for pets, and soaking up attention like he’s known you forever.</p><p><br></p><p>This sweet boy loves toys — especially soft toys and tennis balls — and will proudly bring them over to show off.

He knows how to sit, is treat-motivated, and does well transitioning in and out of his kennel. While he may show mild excitement when he sees other dogs, it’s friendly curiosity — he’s non-reactive passing kennels and even stops to give sweet greetings through the gate, complete with wiggly tails and nose kisses.</p><p><br></p><p>He enjoys sniffing around, spending time with people, and would thrive in a home that offers love, routine, and maybe a few good toys to toss around.

She’s clumsy in the most endearing way, loves climbing right into your lap (despite being far too big for it), has </span><em style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">zero</em><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> concept of personal space and will definitely stare at you like you’re her favorite person in the world. Personal space? Never heard of it. Whether she’s doing zoomies across the yard or melting into the couch, Penny’s favorite place is wherever </span><em style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">you</em><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> are.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">Penny is very food-motivated — and while her attention span might rival that of a gnat (or a chicken nugget 🍗), she’s smart and eager to please. She’s what we like to call a </span><em style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">“pay-me-first”</em><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> type of employee.

The good news? She’s starting to respond to commands without a treat in sight — progress, people!</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">She’s still learning her strength when it comes to jumping up and gentle mouthing during play, so continued guidance will help her polish those puppy manners. She’s house-trained and crate-trained, has never had an accident indoors, and sleeps soundly through the night. She may whine a bit when you leave or head upstairs (she’s just making sure you remember how much she loves you), but she’s improving as she gains confidence and trust.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">She’s shown interest in other dogs and has been friendly with neighborhood pups, though she can get a bit too excited during greetings. Penny would thrive in a home where she gets plenty of attention, consistent training, and space to zoom around.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">She’s a medium-energy girl who needs time to play, but she’s just as happy to curl up beside you for hours.

Her matts have been shaved off and for the first time in years she is walking on her real paws, she can feel wind on her skin, her body is capable of full stretches, she can run and fully \"feel\" again. With that comes time to adjust to her new body and touch, requiring understanding, patience and light management by her VIPs. She loves love and has a spirit that will warm your soul, but can be subject to occasional startles--her body is new to her..</p><p>\n</p><p>Lady Pablo seems to be very content near cats.</p><p>She's had limited engagement with dogs and seems to mostly co-exist, although we think she would prefer to have all of the people attention for herself.</p><p>\n</p><p>Her ideal person or people will have some experience with small dogs that need a little extra help and guidance in life, It's her turn to catch up for all the years she's lost out on.</p><p>\n</p><p>Interested in learning more?</p><p>Click on her link to reach her foster parents.</p>",

Goldie is a lovely sweet goofball and will grow up to be an elegant, long-legged blonde!&nbsp;If she was a person, she'd be a supermodel! At 9 months old she is about 50 pounds and will likely top out around 60 pounds She can be a little shy meeting new humans, but warms up quickly. She recently attended several busy adoption events full of new people, dogs, sights and sounds and Goldie was a perfect little lady and behaved beautifully. She was great with all the kids who stopped to pet her as well. She is about 99% potty trained and she's a natural at walking on a loose leash! She adores fetch and tug-of-war. She loves to play with other dogs and wears out her two big canine foster brothers running around the yard. She has been around a cat and wanted to play with it. But she's still a puppy and can adapt to living with cats. This sweet little lady would make a stellar family dog and a great active buddy for anyone looking for a pup that is equal parts energetic adventurer and snugglebug!&nbsp;Could she be your dreamgirl???</p>",

Her top priorities are snuggles and pillow princess naps, and activities such as supervising squirrels and sticks, and rumpus time with toys or dog friends. Flora loves doing whatever you're doing. She's well-behaved and engaged on walks, plays well with my dog, and learns games and tricks easily. If left to her own devices, she'll make a nest of any available pillows and chill. She's untested with children, but she's a mama, very gentle and sweet with everyone. Flora is housetrained, solid on basic commands, treat motivated and eager to please. She's working on leash reactivity, and responding well to redirection. Flora is so chill, when you give her a loving home she'll be happy with the daily activities of your household. Flora is spayed and chipped, up to date on vaccinations, and takes Symparica Trio monthly. She's in great shape, no known conditions.</span></p>",

    "description_html": "<p>Hi, my name is Holly, or Holly Doll as my mom likes to call me. I guess she always tells me that I am such a doll…whatever that means. I want to start off by saying that I am really, really laid back. I think they call me a lap dog, which I laugh at, because I really am too big for your lap, but I enjoy snuggling up all close to you and laying in your lap and giving you tons of affection.&nbsp;I do love playing with my big Boxer sister, but I look forward to my downtime where I can stretch my body out and just relax. I will get along with any dog really, as I am mild mannered and incredibly respectful of their space, food, toys and treats.</p><p>I do love a good squeaky toy every now and then, too. I enjoy my walks and I am very, very good on a leash. I get so excited when I see people or other dogs when I am out, but I cannot help it, I enjoy the attention and want to play!! &nbsp;I am working on controlling my excitement though – which is no fun. I appear to be good with kids, although I don’t currently live with any, but my mom can tell how happy I get when we see kids out and about. I wag my tail really fast and tap my feet and try to pull her near them. I don’t know if I am good with cats either. I do not currently live with any and we haven’t come across any on my walks. I can keep you posted though. </p><p>I am crate, leash, house and potty trained. I learn very quickly and I love the one-on-one time I get with my mom when she is teaching me. &nbsp;I am not a big barker, although my Boxer sister sometimes tries to get me to join in with her, but I can resist. I like riding in cars and will jump right in to go anywhere.</p><p>Overall, I am a wonderful pup. I can have little bursts of puppy energy, but for most of the day, I am laid back. I am super friendly and sweet. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

    "description_html": "<p>Meet Chip! Chip is a curious yet gentle bunny who enjoys exploring and spending time around people on his own terms. He likes to approach for attention and investigation, then retreat to his pen when he's ready to relax. Chip communicates clearly when he needs space, so he'd do best with someone who understands and respects bunny boundaries. He loves head and back rubs, but prefers not to have his feet or belly touched and does not enjoy being picked up. Carrots are his favorite treat, while bananas are a definite no! Chip can be sensitive to loud noises, so a calm home without very young children or dogs would suit him best. With the right introduction, he may also be a good candidate for bonding with another rabbit. Overall, Chip is a sweet, thoughtful bunny who will thrive in a patient, loving home that lets him blossom at his own pace. 🐰💛</p>",

    "description_html": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Sweet, adorable Minnie stares deep into your eyes probably more than any other little cat you know, making you feel like you’re the absolute best.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Minnie loves to begin her day with a play sesh featuring the best-ever fishing pole wand toy, where she might convince even you that the feathers on the end of it are actually a bird! Her mouser skills are incredible — Minnie hunkers down, pupils wide, tracking every twitch of the feathers until just the right moment to SPRINT into action. On carpet or a rug, she has impressive speed and agility! And when that “bird” takes flight, Minnie transforms into a (still overwhelmingly adorable) fierce aerial hunter, launching into the air with entertaining acrobatics to pluck her prey out of the sky. Her second favorite game to play involves a donut shaped tunnel with two entry points. She will dash into it, and if you tease the outside of the tunnel with a stick or fabric covered wire (in our case), she goes absolutely berserk attacking it from within— make absolutely sure you don’t touch the tunnel with any part of your body because she is in the ZONE!! You’ll be so entertained as she uses her claws to pull herself around the tunnel on her back! She’s such a funny little playmate!</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Minnie came to us off the street, but she clearly was raised by humans, as she wants to spend as much time with them as possible. She is very vocal, and loves to talk to you. She has all sorts of thoughts about everything! If only we could understand what those thoughts are… If you work from home, Minnie is going to be your reliable coworker, always there to give you a little hit of dopamine or oxytocin throughout your day.

    "description_html": "<p>This is a feral momma kitty who I have been working on taming in foster with her babies. She's still likely to hiss if approached too quickly and be tightened up as hard as a rock when you touch her, but with some dedication I have gotten her to start relaxing during pets and even put her chin up and press into some neck and chin scritches. Definitely can't pick her up with your hands, but placing a blanket or towel over her makes her limp enough to handle and transport her. I believe she can be domesticated and put into a good home, but it will take continued work. Named Persephone because I got two kittens from her the year before these four kittens, so she was like Persephone coming back from the underworld every year bringing me new pretty babies. She has now been spayed to end that cycle!</p>",

    "description_html": "<h2>Meet Hot Dog</h2><p>He earned his namesake after being found hiding, trying not to be noticed, near a home that was vacated due to a fire. Since being brought in as a foster, he's taken nicely with everyone in the household including a lady dog, two lady cats and two humans. Hot Dog loves to quietly shadow his people through the house. He also loves cuddles. His energy level is low to medium with the occasional daily burst of energy to play fetch or squish a tennis ball for instance. He rides well in the car. He's refining all his indoor skills beautifully - we don't know how long he lived outdoors. If you would like to meet up, please apply on his link - there's no commitment and a trip to the shelter is not required unless you would like to have a doggie meet up which will be scheduled there after meeting Hot Dog in person.</p>",

She’s a total cuddle bug who loves leaning on you, touching you, and sleeping right on top of you like a weighted blanket. She has a goofy, funny personality and is incredibly sweet with people.</p><p>She has low-to-medium energy and is happy with a mix of playtime (fetch, tug, chew toys) and lots of naps. She can do well in an apartment as long as she gets daily walks.</p><p>Gemma is very strong and currently a big puller on leash, especially when she sees other dogs, so continued leash training will be important. That said, she has shown no aggression on walks and rarely barks. She takes treats gently and is food-motivated, which should make training easier.</p><p>At home, Gemma is a dream. She’s fully potty trained with no accidents, sleeps through the night, and is not destructive. She currently lives with two adults and has done great. Her compatibility with other dogs, cats, and kids is still being evaluated; due to her size and excitement level, she’d do best with children 10+. Slow, thoughtful introductions to other dogs are recommended.</p><p>If you’re looking for a cuddly, loyal companion with a big heart and a great sense of humor, Gemma might be your perfect match.</p><p>See more of her at @keep.austin.furry 💛</p>",

He is perfectly housetrained and naps most of the day with the occasional request for some scritches.

He is a quiet boy (zero barking) and takes treats gently from your hand like a dainty prince.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Milo loves sniffs and exploring outside; he would do great in a house with a secure yard or an apartment where he gets some good walks. Milo could fit in with most any lifestyle - he’s laid back so doesn’t need a ton of exercise/stimulation, but could also be a great running buddy. Milo would be the perfect family dog - he has experience living with another dog in his foster home and before the shelter lived with an older child and a cat!</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">And did we mention his ears?!

She is FIV+, but as long as she gets along with her cat siblings, it's fine (FIV can't be transmitted through grooming or sharing food, only deep bites).</p><p>Violet prefers to be near you rather than in your lap, whether you're cooking in the kitchen or watching tv on the couch, she's always a few feet away and will start purring when you're nearby. She is very calm and prefers to sleep most of the time, but she does want daily pets and brushing, and she is easy to pick up. When you leave for work in the morning, you will find her sitting in the same comfy spot on the couch as when you left, making her a great companion for those who aren't home for most of the day. If this easy-going senior gal sounds like a fit for you, take the first steps to meet her today!</p>",

With gentle guidance, consistency, and lots of love, he’ll blossom into a confident, happy companion. He’s the kind of dog who will form a deep bond with his people and remind you how powerful kindness can be.</p><p><br></p><p>If you have a soft voice, a calm home, and room in your heart for a dog who just needs to know he’s safe and loved, Socks is ready to be your loyal little shadow 🐾💛</p>",
